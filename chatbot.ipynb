The question: \"What factors should I consider when calculating the ground risk buffer for my drone's parachute system?\" The context says ground risk buffer is defined by 1:1 rule, but can be smaller for rotary-wing using ballistic methodology acceptable to authority. Also may need refinement based on SORA Step 9, adjacent air and ground risks. Also must be within sparsely populated area, evaluate area of operations, justify lower density of people at risk.

The context includes two documents: [102] Operational Mitigations and Risk Buffers for PDRA-S01 Operations, and [109] Operational Mitigations and PDRA Conditions for UAS Operations under EASA SORA. The question: \"Are there specific formulas or methods recommended for calculating the ground risk buffer in drone parachute systems?\" The context does not mention parachute systems specifically. It mentions ground risk buffer definitions for untethered unmanned aircraft. It gives a table of minimum ground risk buffer distances based on maximum height above ground level and maximum take-off mass. It also mentions the 1:1 rule for ground risk buffer at 150m. It does not mention parachute systems. The question is about \"drone parachute systems\". The context does not mention parachute systems. So we need to answer based on the context. The user asks if there are specific formulas or methods recommended for calculating the ground risk buffer in drone parachute systems. The context does not mention parachute systems. So we must say that the context does not provide specific formulas or methods for calculating ground risk buffer in drone parachute systems. We can mention that the context provides guidelines for ground risk buffer for untethered unmanned aircraft based on maximum height and maximum take-off mass, but no mention of parachute systems. So we can answer that there is no specific formula or method for parachute systems in the provided context. We can also mention that the context includes a table of minimum ground risk buffer distances for untethered unmanned aircraft. We can also mention the 1:1 rule for 150m.

We must separate facts from interpretation. The facts: The context provides a table of minimum ground risk buffer distances for untethered unmanned aircraft based on maximum height and maximum take-off mass. The 1:1 rule for 150m. The context does not mention parachute systems. The interpretation: No specific formulas or methods for parachute systems are provided in the context. So we can answer accordingly. The user specifically asks: \"Are there specific formulas or methods recommended for calculating the ground risk buffer in drone parachute systems?\" We can answer: The context does not provide any formulas or methods for parachute systems. The context only provides guidelines for ground risk buffer for untethered unmanned aircraft. So we can answer that. We must not mention that we are referencing the context. We must keep the answer concise. We can use bullet points. We can label sections: \"Facts\" and \"Interpretation.\" That is the best approach.\n",
