The operational risk assessment may be carried out using the methodology described in AMC1 Article 11 of the UAS Regulation. This methodology is essentially the specific operations risk assessment, known as SORA, which was developed by JARUS. While SORA is presented as an acceptable means of compliance, other methodologies may also be used by the UAS operator as alternative means of compliance, provided they satisfy the regulatory requirements.\n\nIt is clarified that unmanned free balloons are considered unmanned aircraft and must therefore comply with Regulation (EU) 2019/947. For this specific type of aircraft, compliance with Appendix 2 to Regulation (EU) No 923/2012 is regarded as an acceptable means of compliance with Article 11.\n\nThe text further explains that aspects other than safety, including security, privacy, environmental protection, and the use of the radio frequency spectrum, should be assessed separately. These aspects must be addressed in accordance with the applicable requirements established by the Member State in which the operation is intended to take place, or in accordance with other relevant EU regulations.\n\nFor certain UAS operations that fall within the ‘specific’ category, alternatives to conducting a full risk assessment are available. For UAS operations with lower intrinsic risks, a declaration may be submitted when the operation complies with the standard scenarios listed in Appendix 1 to the UAS Regulation. A summary of these standard scenarios is provided in Table 1. For other UAS operations, a request for authorisation may be submitted based on the mitigations and provisions described in a predefined risk assessment, provided that the UAS operation meets the operational characterisation described in AMC2 and subsequent provisions to Article 11 of the UAS Regulation. A summary of the predefined risk assessments that have been published so far is provided in Table 2.\n\nThe text notes that while standard scenarios are described in a detailed and prescriptive manner, the provisions and mitigations contained in predefined risk assessments are described in a more generic way. This approach is intended to provide flexibility to UAS operators and competent authorities, allowing them to establish more prescriptive limitations and provisions that are adapted to the specific characteristics of the intended operation. Two types of predefined risk assessments are identified. One type consists of PDRAs derived from a standard scenario, which allow the UAS operator to conduct similar operations but using, for example, UAS without the class label required by the standard scenario, such as privately built UAS. The second type consists of more generic PDRAs.\n\nThe codification of a predefined risk assessment includes the letter ‘G’ or ‘S’, such as PDRA-G01 or PDRA-S01. The letter ‘G’ designates generic PDRAs. The letter ‘S’ designates PDRAs that are derived from a standard scenario and have the same level of prescriptiveness as the corresponding standard scenario. These PDRAs, although they apply to UAS operations that require operational authorisation in order to allow the use of UAS without a class label, are expected to enable an even more simplified authorisation process compared to other PDRAs that are not related to standard scenarios. Ideally, for operations conducted on the basis of such PDRAs, competent authorities may implement expedited operational authorisation processes. These processes may be based on a review of the documentation submitted by the UAS operator to support the declaration of compliance with the PDRA provisions.\n\nIn accordance with Article 11 of the UAS Regulation, the applicant is required to collect and provide the relevant technical, operational, and system information needed to assess the risk associated with the intended UAS operation. The SORA methodology described in AMC1 Article 11 provides a detailed framework for this data collection and presentation. The concept of operations, or ConOps, description forms the foundation for all other activities and should be as accurate and detailed as possible. The ConOps should not only describe the operation itself but also provide insight into the UAS operator’s operational safety culture. It should further include information on how and when interaction with the air navigation service provider is expected, where applicable.\n\nIt is also specified that predefined risk assessments address only safety risks. As a result, additional limitations and provisions may need to be included after considering other types of risks, such as security or privacy risks.\n\nWhen a UAS operator intends to conduct an operation covered by a predefined risk assessment, the operator should complete the last two columns of the table related to the selected PDRA, titled ‘integrity’ and ‘proof’. In the integrity column, the operator explains how the required level of integrity is met, and in the proof column, how that level of integrity is demonstrated. To support UAS operators, these two columns are already prefilled, although operators may adapt the text to suit their specific needs.\n\nIf a UAS operation does not fully fit within the limits defined by a predefined risk assessment, the UAS operator is required to carry out a full risk assessment and submit it to the competent authority. Changes to a predefined risk assessment should not be made unless the competent authority accepts that minor changes may be introduced.\n\nFor the purposes of the SORA methodology, specific definitions are provided. A ‘populated area’ should be understood as a ‘congested area’, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 965/2012, meaning any area within a city, town, or settlement that is substantially used for residential, commercial, or recreational purposes.

    "chunk_title": "SORA Introduction, Robustness Concept, and Roles and Responsibilities",
    "chunk_text": "This text introduces the Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA) and explains its intent, scope, key concepts, and the main actors involved. The preface states that SORA is based on a document developed by JARUS and provides a vision for how to safely create, evaluate, and conduct an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operation. It provides a methodology to guide both the UAS operator and the competent authority in determining whether a UAS operation can be conducted safely. It is explicitly not meant to be used as a checklist and is not expected to provide answers to all challenges related to UAS integration in airspace. Instead, it functions as a tailoring guide that helps a UAS operator find the best-fit mitigation means to reduce risk to an acceptable level. Because of this tailoring approach, it does not include prescriptive requirements, but rather defines safety objectives that must be met at different levels of robustness, commensurate with the level of risk. The text also notes that SORA is intended to inspire UAS operators and competent authorities and to highlight the benefits of a harmonised risk assessment methodology, with feedback from real-life operations forming the backbone of future revisions.\n\nThe purpose section explains that SORA proposes a methodology to serve as an acceptable means of demonstrating compliance with Article 11 of the UAS Regulation by evaluating risks and determining the acceptability of a proposed UAS operation within the ‘specific’ category. It explains that the ‘specific’ category cannot automatically rely on the safety and performance data established by the large number of unmanned aircraft operating in the ‘open’ category, due to operational differences and increased levels of risk. SORA therefore provides a consistent approach to assessing additional risks linked to expanded and new UAS operations that are not covered by the ‘open’ category. It also clarifies that SORA is not intended to be a one-stop-shop for full integration of all UAS types in all airspace classes. The methodology may be applied where traditional aircraft certification approaches—approving the design, issuing an airworthiness approval, and issuing a type certificate—may not be appropriate because an applicant wishes to operate a UAS in a limited or restricted manner. It may also support activities needed to determine associated airworthiness requirements, on the assumption that safety objectives set forth in, or derived from, those applicable to the ‘certified’ category are consistent with those set forth or derived for the ‘specific’ category. The methodology is described as being based on a holistic or total system safety, risk-based assessment model that evaluates risks for a given UAS operation by considering threats associated with a specified hazard, relevant design aspects, and proposed operational mitigations. SORA helps evaluate risks systematically and determine the boundaries required for safe operation. It allows the applicant to determine acceptable risk levels and validate that proposed operations comply with those levels, while also allowing the competent authority to gain confidence that the operator can conduct the operation safely. To avoid repetitive individual approvals, EASA will apply the methodology to define ‘standard scenarios’ or ‘predefined risk assessments’ for identified types of ConOps with known hazards and acceptable risk mitigations. The processes and values in the document are intended to guide the UAS operator in performing a risk assessment in accordance with Article 11 of the UAS Regulation.\n\nThe applicability section states that the methodology is aimed at evaluating safety risks for UAS operations of any class, size, or type, including military, experimental, research and development, and prototyping operations, and is particularly suited—though not limited—to ‘specific’ operations where a hazard and risk assessment are required. Safety risks associated with collisions between unmanned aircraft and manned aircraft are within scope, while the risk of collisions between two unmanned aircraft, or between an unmanned aircraft and an unmanned aircraft carrying people, is noted as something to be addressed in future revisions. The carriage of people or payloads on board the UAS that introduce additional hazards, such as weapons, is explicitly excluded from the methodology’s scope in the event of a mishap. Security aspects are excluded when they go beyond those confined to the airworthiness of the systems, with the example of protection from unlawful electromagnetic interference. Privacy and financial aspects are also excluded. The text notes that SORA can be used to support waiving regulatory requirements applicable to the operation if it can be demonstrated that the operation can be conducted with an acceptable level of safety. It further states that, in addition to performing SORA in accordance with the UAS Regulation, the UAS operator must ensure compliance with all other regulatory requirements applicable to the operation that are not necessarily addressed by SORA.\n\nKey concepts and definitions include a semantic model and the concept of robustness. The semantic model is presented as requiring standardised terminology for phases of operation, procedures, and operational volumes to facilitate effective communication of all SORA aspects. It states that Figure 1 provides consistent use of terms for all users and that Figure 2 provides a graphical representation to help understanding. The introduction to robustness explains that any risk mitigation or operational safety objective can be demonstrated at different levels of robustness, and SORA proposes three levels—low, medium, and high—commensurate with risk. Robustness is achieved by combining the level of integrity, described as the safety gain provided by each mitigation, with the level of assurance, described as the method of proof that the claimed safety gain has been achieved, and both are risk-based. Activities to substantiate integrity are detailed in Annexes B, C, D, and E, which provide guidance material or reference industry standards and practices where applicable. General guidance for assurance is then provided: a low level of assurance is where the applicant simply declares that the required integrity has been achieved; a medium level of assurance is where the applicant provides supporting evidence that integrity has been achieved, typically through testing for technical mitigations or proof of experience for human-related mitigations; and a high level of assurance is where achieved integrity has been found acceptable by a competent third party. The text states that specific criteria in the annexes take precedence over the general criteria and notes that Table 1 provides guidance to determine robustness based on integrity and assurance. An example is given that if an applicant demonstrates a medium level of integrity with a low level of assurance, the overall robustness is considered low, and robustness is always equal to the lowest level of either integrity or assurance.\n\nThe roles and responsibilities section identifies key actors that may need to interact during different phases of the SORA process. The UAS operator is described as responsible for safe operation of the UAS and therefore for the safety risk analysis. In accordance with Article 5 of the UAS Regulation, the UAS operator must substantiate safety by performing the specific operational and risk assessment except in cases defined by Article 5, and supporting material may be provided by third parties such as manufacturers, U-space service providers, and others. The UAS operator obtains an operational authorisation from the competent authority or ANSP. It is stated that a UAS operator with a LUC cannot be granted the privilege to assess compliance with design requirements when a UAS with a design verification report or a (restricted) type certificate is required.\n\nThe applicant is identified as the party seeking operational approval and becomes the UAS operator once the operation is approved. The UAS manufacturer is defined as the party that designs and or produces the UAS and is described as having unique design evidence, such as evidence for system performance, system architecture, software and hardware development documentation, and test or analysis documentation, which may be shared with UAS operators or the competent authority to support the safety case. The text notes that a potential UAS manufacturer may also use SORA to target design objectives for specific or generalised operations and that these design objectives may be complemented by certification specifications or industry consensus standards if acceptable to EASA to obtain airworthiness approvals. A component manufacturer is similarly defined as designing and or producing components and holding unique design evidence that may be shared to substantiate a safety case.\n\nThe competent authority is defined as the authority designated by the Member State under Article 17 of the UAS Regulation to assess the safety case and issue operational authorisation under Article 12. The competent authority may accept a SORA submission in whole or in part, and the applicant may need to consult the authority to ensure consistent application or interpretation of steps. The competent authority must oversee the UAS operator under Article 18. The text explains that, under Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, EASA is the competent authority in the EU to verify compliance of UAS design and components with applicable rules, while the Member State’s designated authority verifies compliance with operational requirements and personnel competency. It lists design-related elements including OSOs #02 (limited to design criteria), #04, #05, #06, #10, #12, #18, #19 (limited to criterion #3), #20, #23 (limited to criterion #1), and #24; the M2 mitigation for ground risk (criterion #1); and verification of the containment system to avoid infringement of adjacent ground areas or airspace in Step #9. It states that if an operation is classified as SAIL V or VI, compliance with design-related SORA provisions should be demonstrated through a type certificate issued by EASA under Annex I (Part 21) to Regulation (EU) No 748/2012, as defined in Article 40(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) 2019/945. For other OSOs and mitigation means, the competent authority may verify compliance or identify a third party able to verify compliance. If the operation is SAIL IV, compliance with design-related SORA provisions should be demonstrated through a design verification report issued by EASA, while evidence for other OSOs and mitigations not related to design is provided to the competent authority according to the robustness level and assessed as part of the authorisation application. If the operation is SAIL I, II, or III, the competent authority may accept a declaration from the operator for compliance with design-related OSOs and mitigations and may check statements regarding claimed integrity and robustness for the considered SAIL. It also states that despite the SAIL, when the claimed robustness level for mitigation means M2 is high, the competent authority should require use of a UAS with a design verification report issued by EASA limited to compliance with those mitigation means.\n\nThe ANSP is described as the designated provider of air traffic service in a specific area of operation and assesses whether the proposed flight can be safely conducted in the airspace it covers, authorising the flight if it is safe. U-space service providers are described as entities providing services to support safe and efficient use of airspace. The remote pilot is described as being designated by the UAS operator, or in general aviation by the aircraft owner, and charged with safely conducting the flight.",

This text introduces the Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA) and explains its intent, scope, key concepts, and the main actors involved. The preface states that SORA is based on a document developed by JARUS and provides a vision for how to safely create, evaluate, and conduct an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) operation. It provides a methodology to guide both the UAS operator and the competent authority in determining whether a UAS operation can be conducted safely. It is explicitly not meant to be used as a checklist and is not expected to provide answers to all challenges related to UAS integration in airspace. Instead, it functions as a tailoring guide that helps a UAS operator find the best-fit mitigation means to reduce risk to an acceptable level. Because of this tailoring approach, it does not include prescriptive requirements, but rather defines safety objectives that must be met at different levels of robustness, commensurate with the level of risk. The text also notes that SORA is intended to inspire UAS operators and competent authorities and to highlight the benefits of a harmonised risk assessment methodology, with feedback from real-life operations forming the backbone of future revisions.\n\nThe purpose section explains that SORA proposes a methodology to serve as an acceptable means of demonstrating compliance with Article 11 of the UAS Regulation by evaluating risks and determining the acceptability of a proposed UAS operation within the ‘specific’ category. It explains that the ‘specific’ category cannot automatically rely on the safety and performance data established by the large number of unmanned aircraft operating in the ‘open’ category, due to operational differences and increased levels of risk. SORA therefore provides a consistent approach to assessing additional risks linked to expanded and new UAS operations that are not covered by the ‘open’ category. It also clarifies that SORA is not intended to be a one-stop-shop for full integration of all UAS types in all airspace classes. The methodology may be applied where traditional aircraft certification approaches—approving the design, issuing an airworthiness approval, and issuing a type certificate—may not be appropriate because an applicant wishes to operate a UAS in a limited or restricted manner. It may also support activities needed to determine associated airworthiness requirements, on the assumption that safety objectives set forth in, or derived from, those applicable to the ‘certified’ category are consistent with those set forth or derived for the ‘specific’ category.

    "chunk_text": "This section explains the foundations of risk within the Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA) methodology and outlines how the SORA process is structured and applied. Risk is defined in accordance with SAE ARP 4754A and EUROCAE ED-79A as the combination of the frequency or probability of an occurrence and its associated level of severity. This definition is retained throughout the SORA methodology. The consequence of an occurrence is designated as harm of some type.\n\nIt is explained that many categories of harm can arise from a single occurrence. However, this document focuses on occurrences of harm, such as a UAS crash, that are short-lived and typically give rise to a near loss of life. Chronic events, such as toxic emissions over a long period of time, are explicitly excluded from the assessment. Within this scope, the categories of harm considered are the potential for fatal injuries to third parties on the ground, fatal injuries to third parties in the air, and damage to critical infrastructure.\n\nIt is acknowledged that competent authorities may, when appropriate, consider additional categories of harm, such as disruption of a community, environmental damage, or financial loss. The methodology could also be used to address those additional categories if required.\n\nThe text explains that several studies have shown that the amount of energy required to cause fatal injuries in the case of a direct hit is extremely low, in the region of only a few dozen joules. The energy levels involved in the operations addressed by this document are likely to be significantly higher. As a result, the retained harm within the SORA is the potential for fatal injuries. By applying the methodology, the applicant may claim lower lethality either on a case-by-case basis or systematically if permitted by the competent authority, for example in the ‘open’ category.\n\nFatal injury is described as a well-defined condition that is recognised by authorities in most countries. As a result, the risk of under-reporting fatalities is considered almost non-existent, and the quantification of fatality risk is relatively straightforward. Fatalities are usually measured as the number of deaths within a given time interval, such as a fatal accident rate per million flying hours, or as the number of deaths for a specific circumstance, such as a fatal accident rate per number of take-offs.\n\nBy contrast, damage to critical infrastructure is identified as a more complex condition. The quantification of the associated risks may therefore be difficult and may require cooperation with the organisation responsible for that infrastructure.\n\nThe SORA process outline explains that the methodology provides a logical and structured process to analyse the proposed concept of operations and to establish an adequate level of confidence that the operation can be conducted with an acceptable level of risk. The methodology is supported by ten steps, each of which is described in subsequent sections and further detailed, where necessary, in the relevant annexes.\n\nThe SORA focuses primarily on the assessment of air risk and ground risk. In addition to these, a separate risk assessment of critical infrastructure should also be performed. This assessment should be carried out in cooperation with the organisation responsible for the infrastructure, as that organisation is best placed to understand the associated threats. The ten steps of the risk model are illustrated in Figure 3, and Figure 4 provides an overall understanding of how to arrive at an air risk class for a given operation.\n\nBefore starting the SORA process, a pre-application evaluation is required. The applicant should first verify that the proposed operation is feasible and not subject to specific exclusions by the competent authority or already covered by a standard scenario. The applicant should verify whether the operation falls under the ‘open’ category, whether it is covered by a standard scenario included in the appendix to the UAS Regulation or by a predefined risk assessment published by EASA, whether it falls under the ‘certified’ category, or whether it is subject to a specific no-go decision from the competent authority.

    "chunk_title": "Step #2 of the SORA Process: Determination of the Intrinsic UAS Ground Risk Class",
    "chunk_text": "This content describes Step #2 of the SORA process, which establishes the intrinsic ground risk class of a UAS operation. The intrinsic ground risk relates to the risk of a person being struck by the unmanned aircraft in the event of a loss of control, assuming a reasonable level of safety. The purpose of this step is to characterise the unmitigated ground risk before applying additional risk reductions.\n\nTo determine the intrinsic ground risk class, the applicant must identify the maximum characteristic dimension of the unmanned aircraft. Examples of this dimension include wingspan for fixed-wing aircraft, blade diameter for rotorcraft, or the maximum overall dimension for multicopters. This characteristic dimension is considered together with knowledge of the intended operational scenario.\n\nThe applicant must also define the area at risk during the operation, referred to as the area of operation. This includes the operational volume, which consists of the flight geography and the contingency volume. In defining the operational volume, the applicant should consider the position-keeping capability of the UAS in four dimensions, including latitude, longitude, height, and time.

The purpose of this step is to characterise the unmitigated ground risk before applying additional risk reductions.\n\nTo determine the intrinsic ground risk class, the applicant must identify the maximum characteristic dimension of the unmanned aircraft.

    "chunk_text": "This content explains Step #6 of the SORA process, which addresses Tactical Mitigation Performance Requirements, known as TMPR, and their associated robustness levels. Tactical mitigations are applied to reduce any residual risk of a mid-air collision so that the applicable airspace safety objective is achieved. These mitigations may take the form of visual ‘see and avoid’ operations conducted under visual line of sight, or they may rely on technical systems that provide alternative means of achieving the airspace safety objective, such as detect-and-avoid systems or combinations of multiple detect-and-avoid systems. Annex D is referenced as providing the method for applying these tactical mitigations.\n\nOperations conducted under visual line of sight are considered an acceptable tactical mitigation for collision risk for all air risk classes. Even so, the UAS operator is advised to consider additional measures to increase situational awareness of air traffic in the vicinity of the operational volume. Flights conducted under visual line of sight are not required to meet TMPR or TMPR robustness requirements. In operations consisting of multiple flight segments, only those segments conducted beyond visual line of sight are required to meet TMPR and robustness requirements. Extended visual line of sight operations generally follow the same requirements as visual line of sight operations, but may include additional constraints. In particular, the verification and communication latency between the remote pilot and observers must be less than 15 seconds.\n\nFor visual line of sight operations, the applicant is expected to have a documented de-confliction scheme. This scheme explains the methods used for traffic detection and defines the criteria applied to decide when to avoid incoming traffic. If observers are used for detection, the phraseology to be used must also be described. It is assumed that observers are generally unable to detect traffic beyond two nautical miles, although this range is not fixed and may vary depending on factors such as atmospheric conditions, aircraft size, geometry, and closing rate. As a result, the UAS operator may need to adjust the operation or procedures accordingly.\n\nFor operations other than visual line of sight, the applicant uses the residual air risk class together with the referenced table to determine the applicable TMPR. A high TMPR applies to airspace where manned aircraft encounter rates are high and or where strategic mitigations are limited, resulting in a high residual collision risk. In such airspace, the UAS may operate in integrated airspace and must comply with applicable operating rules and procedures without reducing capacity, decreasing safety, negatively affecting manned aircraft operations, or increasing risk to airspace users or people and property on the ground. The required performance and variety of tactical mitigations are higher than for other air risk classes, and routine operations in this environment are expected to comply with recognised detect-and-avoid system standards, such as those developed by RTCA SC-228 or EUROCAE WG-105.\n\nA medium TMPR applies where the likelihood of encountering manned aircraft is reasonable and or where strategic mitigations are of medium effectiveness. Operations at this level are typically supported by systems already used in aviation to aid the remote pilot in detecting other aircraft, or by systems designed for aviation and built to a corresponding level of robustness. Traffic avoidance manoeuvres at this level may be more advanced than those used for low TMPR operations.\n\nA low TMPR applies where the probability of encountering manned aircraft is low but not negligible, and where strategic mitigations address most of the risk, resulting in a low residual collision risk. Operations at this level may rely on technology that assists the remote pilot in detecting other traffic but is built to lower standards. For example, for operations below 120 metres, traffic avoidance manoeuvres are generally expected to rely on rapid descent to altitudes where manned aircraft are not expected to operate.\n\nNo performance requirement applies in airspace where the manned aircraft encounter rate is expected to be extremely low. In such airspace, there is no requirement for a TMPR, as the risk of collision between a UAS and a manned aircraft is considered acceptable without additional tactical mitigation. Examples include very remote regions where manned aircraft density is extremely low. Annex D provides further information on how to satisfy TMPR objectives based on available tactical mitigations and the required level of robustness.\n\nThe content also explains that additional airspace or operational requirements may be imposed by the competent authority or the air navigation service provider as safety and operational issues arise. Air risk classes are described as generalised qualitative classifications, and local circumstances such as special events may invalidate the assumed aircraft density. Both the competent authority and the UAS operator are expected to understand local airspace and traffic flows and to develop means to alert operators to changes in airspace conditions. Because the SORA cannot cover every possible airspace, operational, or equipment requirement, applicants and competent authorities must work together to identify and address additional requirements. The SORA process should not be used to justify operations in airspace unless the UAS is equipped with the required equipment for that airspace, except where specific exemptions are granted by the competent authority. Operations in controlled airspace, airport or heliport environments, or transponder mandatory zones are likely to require prior approval from the air navigation service provider, and early coordination with the authority is expected.",
    "chunk_summary": "Step #6 of the SORA process defines how tactical mitigations and TMPR are applied to manage mid-air collision risk. Visual line of sight operations generally do not require TMPR, while beyond visual line of sight operations must meet TMPR levels based on residual air risk.

In operations consisting of multiple flight segments, only those segments conducted beyond visual line of sight are required to meet TMPR and robustness requirements. Extended visual line of sight operations generally follow the same requirements as visual line of sight operations, but may include additional constraints. In particular, the verification and communication latency between the remote pilot and observers must be less than 15 seconds.\n\nFor visual line of sight operations, the applicant is expected to have a documented de-confliction scheme. This scheme explains the methods used for traffic detection and defines the criteria applied to decide when to avoid incoming traffic. If observers are used for detection, the phraseology to be used must also be described. It is assumed that observers are generally unable to detect traffic beyond two nautical miles, although this range is not fixed and may vary depending on factors such as atmospheric conditions, aircraft size, geometry, and closing rate. As a result, the UAS operator may need to adjust the operation or procedures accordingly.\n\nFor operations other than visual line of sight, the applicant uses the residual air risk class together with the referenced table to determine the applicable TMPR. A high TMPR applies to airspace where manned aircraft encounter rates are high and or where strategic mitigations are limited, resulting in a high residual collision risk. In such airspace, the UAS may operate in integrated airspace and must comply with applicable operating rules and procedures without reducing capacity, decreasing safety, negatively affecting manned aircraft operations, or increasing risk to airspace users or people and property on the ground. The required performance and variety of tactical mitigations are higher than for other air risk classes, and routine operations in this environment are expected to comply with recognised detect-and-avoid system standards, such as those developed by RTCA SC-228 or EUROCAE WG-105.\n\nA medium TMPR applies where the likelihood of encountering manned aircraft is reasonable and or where strategic mitigations are of medium effectiveness. Operations at this level are typically supported by systems already used in aviation to aid the remote pilot in detecting other aircraft, or by systems designed for aviation and built to a corresponding level of robustness. Traffic avoidance manoeuvres at this level may be more advanced than those used for low TMPR operations.\n\nA low TMPR applies where the probability of encountering manned aircraft is low but not negligible, and where strategic mitigations address most of the risk, resulting in a low residual collision risk. Operations at this level may rely on technology that assists the remote pilot in detecting other traffic but is built to lower standards. For example, for operations below 120 metres, traffic avoidance manoeuvres are generally expected to rely on rapid descent to altitudes where manned aircraft are not expected to operate.\n\nNo performance requirement applies in airspace where the manned aircraft encounter rate is expected to be extremely low. In such airspace, there is no requirement for a TMPR, as the risk of collision between a UAS and a manned aircraft is considered acceptable without additional tactical mitigation. Examples include very remote regions where manned aircraft density is extremely low. Annex D provides further information on how to satisfy TMPR objectives based on available tactical mitigations and the required level of robustness.\n\nThe content also explains that additional airspace or operational requirements may be imposed by the competent authority or the air navigation service provider as safety and operational issues arise. Air risk classes are described as generalised qualitative classifications, and local circumstances such as special events may invalidate the assumed aircraft density. Both the competent authority and the UAS operator are expected to understand local airspace and traffic flows and to develop means to alert operators to changes in airspace conditions. Because the SORA cannot cover every possible airspace, operational, or equipment requirement, applicants and competent authorities must work together to identify and address additional requirements. The SORA process should not be used to justify operations in airspace unless the UAS is equipped with the required equipment for that airspace, except where specific exemptions are granted by the competent authority. Operations in controlled airspace, airport or heliport environments, or transponder mandatory zones are likely to require prior approval from the air navigation service provider, and early coordination with the authority is expected."

These adjacent areas may differ depending on the phase of flight, and the objective is to ensure that such risks are adequately controlled through containment measures.\n\nThe concept of basic containment is introduced with a fundamental safety requirement stating that no probable failure of the UAS or of any external system supporting the operation should lead to the aircraft operating outside the defined operational volume. The term “probable” is understood qualitatively as a failure anticipated to occur one or more times during the entire system or operational life of an item. A failure is defined as an occurrence that prevents a component, part, or element from functioning as intended, while errors may cause failures but are not considered failures themselves. Certain structural or mechanical failures may be excluded if it can be demonstrated that those parts were designed according to aviation industry best practices. Compliance with the basic containment requirement must be substantiated through a design and installation appraisal that includes consideration of design and installation features such as independence, separation, and redundancy, although these features are not mandatory. The appraisal must also address relevant particular risks associated with the concept of operations, such as hail, ice, snow, or electromagnetic interference. The competent authority may accept a declaration of integrity from the applicant, provided that supporting evidence is available.\n\nEnhanced containment requirements apply in specific operational situations. These include operations where adjacent areas contain assemblies of people unless the UAS is already approved for such operations, or where adjacent airspace is classified as ARC-d unless the residual ARC of the airspace within the operational volume is already ARC-d. Enhanced containment also applies when operations take place in a populated area where M1 mitigation has been applied to lower the ground risk class, or when operating within a controlled ground area.\n\nEnhanced containment introduces additional safety requirements. The UAS must be designed to standards considered adequate by the competent authority or in accordance with acceptable means of compliance. Under these conditions, the probability of the unmanned aircraft leaving the operational volume must be less than one event per ten thousand flight hours, and no single failure of the UAS or any supporting external system may result in operation outside the ground risk buffer. Compliance with these requirements must be substantiated through analysis or test data with supporting evidence. Furthermore, software and airborne electronic hardware whose development errors could directly lead to operation outside the ground risk buffer must be developed to an industry standard or methodology recognised as adequate by EASA.\n\nFor unmanned aircraft with a maximum characteristic dimension not exceeding three metres and operated up to SAIL II, the competent authority may accept a declaration of compliance with the applicable means of compliance for Light-UAS.2511. For configurations exceeding the applicability of such means of compliance, the competent authority may still accept declarations supported by evidence, accept alternative means of compliance proposed by the applicant, or require the use of a UAS for which EASA has verified the claimed integrity. It is noted that means of compliance applicable to different UAS configurations are under development, and interim arrangements may be defined by competent authorities for special configurations such as tethered drones.\n\nThe text emphasises that it is not possible to anticipate all local situations when defining adjacent areas and adjacent airspace. Therefore, sound judgement must be exercised by the UAS operator, the competent authority, and the air navigation service provider. Adjacent airspace is generally considered to be the airspace directly bordering the UAS operational volume, and only in exceptional cases should airspace beyond those bordering volumes be included. For example, the definitions are not intended to include busy airport or heliport environments located far from the operational area for small UAS with limited range.

PDRA-S01, edition 1.1 dated January 2022, applies to unmanned aircraft systems with a maximum characteristic dimension of up to 3 metres and a take-off mass of up to 25 kilograms. Operations are conducted under visual line of sight over a controlled ground area that might be located in a populated area. The maximum range from the remote pilot is limited to visual line of sight, the maximum height is 150 metres, and the airspace may be controlled or uncontrolled with a low risk of encounter with manned aircraft. This scenario is associated with AMC4.\n\nPDRA-S02, edition 1.1 dated January 2022, also applies to unmanned aircraft systems with a maximum characteristic dimension of up to 3 metres and a take-off mass of up to 25 kilograms, but allows beyond visual line of sight operations. The overflown area is a controlled ground area that is entirely located in a sparsely populated area. The maximum range from the remote pilot is 2 kilometres when an air observer or air observers are used, or 1 kilometre if no air observer is used. The maximum height is 150 metres, and operations may take place in controlled or uncontrolled airspace with a low risk of encounter with manned aircraft. This scenario is linked to AMC5.\n\nPDRA-G01, edition 1.2 dated January 2022, covers unmanned aircraft systems with a maximum characteristic dimension of up to 3 metres and typical kinetic energy of up to 34 kilojoules. Operations are beyond visual line of sight over a sparsely populated area. If no air observer is used, the maximum range from the remote pilot is up to 1 kilometre. The maximum height is 150 metres, defined as the operational volume. The airspace is uncontrolled, with a low risk of encounter with manned aircraft, and this PDRA is associated with AMC2.\n\nPDRA-G02, edition 1.1 dated January 2022, applies to unmanned aircraft systems with a maximum characteristic dimension of up to 3 metres and typical kinetic energy of up to 34 kilojoules. Operations are beyond visual line of sight over a sparsely populated area. The maximum range from the remote pilot is not applicable because a direct command and control link is used. The maximum height is established for the reserved or segregated airspace for the UAS operation. The applicable airspace is reserved or segregated, and this PDRA is linked to AMC3.\n\nPDRA-G03, edition 1.0 dated January 2022, also applies to unmanned aircraft systems with a maximum characteristic dimension of up to 3 metres and typical kinetic energy of up to 34 kilojoules. Operations are beyond visual line of sight over sparsely populated areas. The maximum range from the remote pilot is not applicable due to a direct command and control link. The maximum height is 50 metres from the ground unless the operation takes place in reserved or segregated airspace. Operations may be conducted in controlled or uncontrolled airspace if the height is below 50 metres, otherwise the airspace must be reserved or segregated. This scenario is associated with AMC6."

    "chunk_title": "Level of Integrity Assessment Criteria for Ground Risk of Non-Tethered M1 Mitigations",
    "chunk_text": "This content describes the level of integrity assessment criteria applied to strategic mitigations for ground risk identified as M1, specifically for non-tethered unmanned aircraft system operations. The assessment is organised around two main criteria, each evaluated against three integrity levels: low, medium, and high.\n\nThe first criterion defines the ground risk buffer. At a low level of integrity, a ground risk buffer is established with at least a one-to-one rule, or for rotary wing unmanned aircraft, it is defined using a ballistic methodology approach that is acceptable to the competent authority. A comment clarifies that if the unmanned aircraft is planned to operate at an altitude of 150 metres, the ground risk buffer should be a minimum of 150 metres. At a medium level of integrity, the ground risk buffer takes into account several considerations, including improbable single malfunctions or failures such as the projection of high-energy parts like rotors and propellers that could lead to operation outside the operational volume. It also considers meteorological conditions such as wind, command and control latencies that affect timely manoeuvrability, unmanned aircraft behaviour when activating a technical containment measure, and overall unmanned aircraft performance. The term “improbable” is explained as meaning unlikely to occur in each unmanned aircraft during its total life, but which may occur several times when considering the total operational life of a number of unmanned aircraft of this type. At a high level of integrity, the definition is the same as for the medium level, with the distinction between medium and high robustness achieved through the level of assurance.\n\nThe second criterion addresses the evaluation of people at risk. At a low level of integrity, the applicant evaluates the area of operations through on-site inspections or appropriate appraisals to justify lowering the density of people at risk. Examples include residential areas during daytime when some people may not be present, or industrial areas at night time for the same reason.

This content describes the level of integrity assessment criteria applied to strategic mitigations for ground risk identified as M1, specifically for non-tethered unmanned aircraft system operations. The assessment is organised around two main criteria, each evaluated against three integrity levels: low, medium, and high.\n\nThe first criterion defines the ground risk buffer. At a low level of integrity, a ground risk buffer is established with at least a one-to-one rule, or for rotary wing unmanned aircraft, it is defined using a ballistic methodology approach that is acceptable to the competent authority. A comment clarifies that if the unmanned aircraft is planned to operate at an altitude of 150 metres, the ground risk buffer should be a minimum of 150 metres. At a medium level of integrity, the ground risk buffer takes into account several considerations, including improbable single malfunctions or failures such as the projection of high-energy parts like rotors and propellers that could lead to operation outside the operational volume. It also considers meteorological conditions such as wind, command and control latencies that affect timely manoeuvrability, unmanned aircraft behaviour when activating a technical containment measure, and overall unmanned aircraft performance. The term “improbable” is explained as meaning unlikely to occur in each unmanned aircraft during its total life, but which may occur several times when considering the total operational life of a number of unmanned aircraft of this type. At a high level of integrity, the definition is the same as for the medium level, with the distinction between medium and high robustness achieved through the level of assurance.\n\nThe second criterion addresses the evaluation of people at risk. At a low level of integrity, the applicant evaluates the area of operations through on-site inspections or appropriate appraisals to justify lowering the density of people at risk. Examples include residential areas during daytime when some people may not be present, or industrial areas at night time for the same reason. At a medium level of integrity, the applicant evaluates the area of operations using authoritative density data, such as data from the U-space data service provider, relevant to the proposed area and time of operation, in order to substantiate a lower density of people at risk. If the applicant claims a reduction due to a sheltered operational environment, they must use an unmanned aircraft of less than 25 kilograms and not fly above 174 knots, and demonstrate that although the operation is conducted in a populated environment, it is reasonable to consider that most non-involved persons will be located within a building.

    "chunk_text": "This content describes the level of assurance criteria applied to M1 strategic mitigations for ground risk, focusing on how applicants demonstrate integrity for different assurance levels. The scope explicitly concerns non-tethered M1 mitigations and addresses two main criteria: the definition of the ground risk buffer and the evaluation of people at risk.\n\nFor Criterion #1, which concerns the definition of the ground risk buffer, three assurance levels are defined. At a low level of assurance, the applicant declares that the required level of integrity is achieved, and supporting evidence may or may not be available. At a medium level of assurance, the applicant provides supporting evidence demonstrating that the required level of integrity has been achieved. This evidence is typically obtained through testing, analysis, simulation, inspection, design review, or operational experience. When simulation is used, the validity of the targeted environment used in the simulation must be justified. At a high level of assurance, the claimed level of integrity is validated by the competent authority of the Member State or by an entity designated by that competent authority. For this criterion, no additional comments are applicable at the high level of assurance.\n\nCriterion #2 addresses the evaluation of people at risk. At a low level of assurance, the applicant declares that the required level of integrity has been achieved, and supporting evidence may or may not be available. At a medium level of assurance, the applicant uses density data to support the claim of risk reduction. This density data consists of an average density map corresponding to the date or time of the operation, derived from a static data source such as census data for night-time operations. For localised operations, such as intra-city delivery or infrastructure inspection, the applicant also submits the proposed route or area of operation to the applicable authority, for example the city police, office of civil protection, or infrastructure owner, in order to verify the claim of a reduced number of people at risk. At a high level of assurance, the approach is the same as for medium assurance, but the density data used to support the risk reduction claim must be a near-real-time density map obtained from a dynamic data source, such as cellular user data, and must be applicable to the specific date and time of the operation.\n\nComments for Criterion #2 indicate that no additional comments apply at the medium and high levels of assurance.",

    "chunk_text": "The information defines qualitative tactical mitigation performance requirements for detect-and-avoid functions, organised by function and by TMPR level, which corresponds to visual line of sight operations and residual air risk classes ARC-a through ARC-d. The covered functions are Detect, Decide, Command, Execute, and Feedback Loop, each with progressively more demanding expectations as the residual air risk increases.\n\nFor the Detect function, visual line of sight operations impose no tactical mitigation performance requirement, and there is also no requirement for ARC-a. At a low TMPR level corresponding to ARC-b, the applicant’s detect-and-avoid plan is expected to enable the operator to detect approximately 50 percent of all aircraft within the detection volume, assuming no failures or defaults. The operator must have awareness of most traffic in the intended operating area, achieved through one or more measures such as web-based real-time aircraft tracking services, low-cost ADS-B In, UAT, FLARM, or PilotAware aircraft trackers, UTM or U-space dynamic geofencing, or monitoring aeronautical radio communications, for example by using a scanner. At a medium TMPR level corresponding to ARC-c, the expectation is to detect approximately 90 percent of all aircraft within the detection volume. This may be achieved using one or a combination of systems or services including ground-based detect-and-avoid or radar, FLARM, PilotAware, ADS-B In or UAT In receivers, air traffic control separation services, UTM or U-space surveillance services, UTM or U-space early conflict detection and resolution services, and active communication with air traffic control and other airspace users. The operator must provide an assessment of the effectiveness of the chosen detection tools or methods. At a high TMPR level corresponding to ARC-d, a system meeting RTCA SC-228 or EUROCAE WG-105 minimum operational performance standards or minimum aviation system performance standards, or similar standards, is required, and it must be installed in accordance with applicable requirements.\n\nFor the Decide function, there is no requirement for visual line of sight operations or for ARC-a. At a low TMPR level corresponding to ARC-b, the UAS operator must have a documented deconfliction scheme explaining which tools or methods are used for detection and what criteria are applied to decide on avoiding incoming traffic. If the remote pilot relies on detection by someone else, the use of phraseology must also be described. An example provided is that the operator initiates a rapid descent if traffic crosses an alert boundary and operates at less than 100 feet, with an observer using the phrase “DESCEND!, DESCEND!, DESCEND!”. At a medium TMPR level corresponding to ARC-c, all requirements of ARC-b apply, with additional expectations. The operator provides an assessment of human-machine interface factors that may affect the remote pilot’s ability to make timely and appropriate decisions, and an assessment of the effectiveness of the tools and methods used for timely detection and avoidance of traffic. In this context, the decision time is defined as enabling the remote pilot to decide within five seconds after an indication of incoming traffic is provided. The operator also provides an assessment of the failure rate or availability of any tool or service intended for use. At a high TMPR level corresponding to ARC-d, a system meeting RTCA SC-228 or EUROCAE WG-105 minimum operational performance standards or minimum aviation system performance standards, or similar standards, is required and installed in accordance with applicable requirements.\n\nFor the Command function, there is no requirement for visual line of sight operations or for ARC-a. At a low TMPR level corresponding to ARC-b, the latency of the entire command and control link, defined as the time between when the remote pilot gives the command and when the aircraft executes it, must not exceed five seconds. At a medium TMPR level corresponding to ARC-c, this latency must not exceed three seconds. At a high TMPR level corresponding to ARC-d, a system meeting RTCA SC-228 or EUROCAE WG-105 minimum operational performance standards or minimum aviation system performance standards, or similar standards, and installed in accordance with applicable requirements, is required.\n\nFor the Execute function, there is no requirement for visual line of sight operations or for ARC-a. At a low TMPR level corresponding to ARC-b, the UAS must be capable of descending to an altitude not higher than the nearest trees, buildings, or infrastructure, or to 60 feet above ground level, whichever is sufficient. The aircraft must be able to descend from its operating altitude to this safe altitude in less than one minute. At a medium TMPR level corresponding to ARC-c, avoidance may rely on vertical and horizontal avoidance manoeuvring and must be defined in standard procedures. Where horizontal manoeuvring is applied, the aircraft must demonstrate adequate performance, including airspeed, acceleration rates, climb and descent rates, and turn rates. Suggested minimum performance criteria are an airspeed greater than 50 knots, a rate of climb or descent of at least 500 feet per minute, and a turn rate of at least three degrees per second. At a high TMPR level corresponding to ARC-d, a system meeting RTCA SC-228 or EUROCAE WG-105 minimum operational performance standards or minimum aviation system performance standards, or similar standards, and installed in accordance with applicable requirements, is required.\n\nFor the Feedback Loop function, there is no requirement for visual line of sight operations or for ARC-a. At a low TMPR level corresponding to ARC-b, where electronic means assist the remote pilot in detecting traffic, the information must be provided with a latency and update rate for intruder data, such as position, speed, altitude, and track, that support the decision criteria. For an assumed three nautical mile threshold, a five-second update rate and a latency of ten seconds are considered adequate. At a medium TMPR level corresponding to ARC-c, information must be provided to the remote pilot with a latency and update rate that support the decision criteria, and the applicant must provide an assessment of aggravated closure rates considering expected traffic, traffic information update rate and latency, command and control link latency, aircraft manoeuvrability, and performance, and must set detection thresholds accordingly. Suggested minimum criteria include intruder and ownship vector data update rates of three seconds or less. At a high TMPR level corresponding to ARC-d, a system meeting RTCA SC-228 or EUROCAE WG-105 minimum operational performance standards or minimum aviation system performance standards, or similar standards, and installed in accordance with applicable airworthiness requirements, is required.\n\nAdditional notes explain that detection must be performed with adequate precision for avoidance manoeuvres to be effective, and that the detection volume is the volume of airspace, in time or space, required to avoid a collision with manned aircraft and is not limited to the sensor’s field of view or field of regard. The size of the detection volume depends on factors such as closing speed, pilot reaction time, system response time, manoeuvrability, and aircraft performance. References to FLARM and PilotAware are provided as examples of commercially available technologies and do not imply endorsement by the approval authority. Possible future applications of automated traffic management systems in a UTM or U-space environment are also noted.",

At a high TMPR level corresponding to ARC-d, a system meeting RTCA SC-228 or EUROCAE WG-105 minimum operational performance standards or minimum aviation system performance standards, or similar standards, is required, and it must be installed in accordance with applicable requirements.\n\nFor the Decide function, there is no requirement for visual line of sight operations or for ARC-a. At a low TMPR level corresponding to ARC-b, the UAS operator must have a documented deconfliction scheme explaining which tools or methods are used for detection and what criteria are applied to decide on avoiding incoming traffic. If the remote pilot relies on detection by someone else, the use of phraseology must also be described. An example provided is that the operator initiates a rapid descent if traffic crosses an alert boundary and operates at less than 100 feet, with an observer using the phrase “DESCEND!, DESCEND!, DESCEND!”. At a medium TMPR level corresponding to ARC-c, all requirements of ARC-b apply, with additional expectations. The operator provides an assessment of human-machine interface factors that may affect the remote pilot’s ability to make timely and appropriate decisions, and an assessment of the effectiveness of the tools and methods used for timely detection and avoidance of traffic. In this context, the decision time is defined as enabling the remote pilot to decide within five seconds after an indication of incoming traffic is provided. The operator also provides an assessment of the failure rate or availability of any tool or service intended for use. At a high TMPR level corresponding to ARC-d, a system meeting RTCA SC-228 or EUROCAE WG-105 minimum operational performance standards or minimum aviation system performance standards, or similar standards, is required and installed in accordance with applicable requirements.\n\nFor the Command function, there is no requirement for visual line of sight operations or for ARC-a. At a low TMPR level corresponding to ARC-b, the latency of the entire command and control link, defined as the time between when the remote pilot gives the command and when the aircraft executes it, must not exceed five seconds. At a medium TMPR level corresponding to ARC-c, this latency must not exceed three seconds. At a high TMPR level corresponding to ARC-d, a system meeting RTCA SC-228 or EUROCAE WG-105 minimum operational performance standards or minimum aviation system performance standards, or similar standards, and installed in accordance with applicable requirements, is required.\n\nFor the Execute function, there is no requirement for visual line of sight operations or for ARC-a. At a low TMPR level corresponding to ARC-b, the UAS must be capable of descending to an altitude not higher than the nearest trees, buildings, or infrastructure, or to 60 feet above ground level, whichever is sufficient. The aircraft must be able to descend from its operating altitude to this safe altitude in less than one minute. At a medium TMPR level corresponding to ARC-c, avoidance may rely on vertical and horizontal avoidance manoeuvring and must be defined in standard procedures. Where horizontal manoeuvring is applied, the aircraft must demonstrate adequate performance, including airspeed, acceleration rates, climb and descent rates, and turn rates. Suggested minimum performance criteria are an airspeed greater than 50 knots, a rate of climb or descent of at least 500 feet per minute, and a turn rate of at least three degrees per second. At a high TMPR level corresponding to ARC-d, a system meeting RTCA SC-228 or EUROCAE WG-105 minimum operational performance standards or minimum aviation system performance standards, or similar standards, and installed in accordance with applicable requirements, is required.\n\nFor the Feedback Loop function, there is no requirement for visual line of sight operations or for ARC-a. At a low TMPR level corresponding to ARC-b, where electronic means assist the remote pilot in detecting traffic, the information must be provided with a latency and update rate for intruder data, such as position, speed, altitude, and track, that support the decision criteria. For an assumed three nautical mile threshold, a five-second update rate and a latency of ten seconds are considered adequate. At a medium TMPR level corresponding to ARC-c, information must be provided to the remote pilot with a latency and update rate that support the decision criteria, and the applicant must provide an assessment of aggravated closure rates considering expected traffic, traffic information update rate and latency, command and control link latency, aircraft manoeuvrability, and performance, and must set detection thresholds accordingly. Suggested minimum criteria include intruder and ownship vector data update rates of three seconds or less. At a high TMPR level corresponding to ARC-d, a system meeting RTCA SC-228 or EUROCAE WG-105 minimum operational performance standards or minimum aviation system performance standards, or similar standards, and installed in accordance with applicable airworthiness requirements, is required.\n\nAdditional notes explain that detection must be performed with adequate precision for avoidance manoeuvres to be effective, and that the detection volume is the volume of airspace, in time or space, required to avoid a collision with manned aircraft and is not limited to the sensor’s field of view or field of regard. The size of the detection volume depends on factors such as closing speed, pilot reaction time, system response time, manoeuvrability, and aircraft performance. References to FLARM and PilotAware are provided as examples of commercially available technologies and do not imply endorsement by the approval authority. Possible future applications of automated traffic management systems in a UTM or U-space environment are also noted."

The information explains the acceptable loss rates for tactical mitigation system function and performance, as well as how integrity and assurance are demonstrated at each TMPR level.\n\nFor the level of integrity, when TMPR is not applicable under ARC-a, the allowable loss of function and performance of the tactical mitigation system is less than one event per 100 flight hours, corresponding to a loss rate of 1E-2 losses per flight hour. This requirement is considered to be met by commercially available products, and no quantitative analysis is required. The same allowable loss rate of less than one per 100 flight hours and the same lack of need for quantitative analysis apply to TMPR Low under ARC-b.\n\nFor TMPR Medium, which corresponds to ARC-c, the allowable loss of function and performance of the tactical mitigation system is less than one per 1 000 flight hours, corresponding to 1E-3 losses per flight hour. This rate is described as being commensurate with a probable failure condition, and such failure conditions are anticipated to occur one or more times during the entire operational life of each aircraft.\n\nFor TMPR High, which corresponds to ARC-d, the allowable loss of function and performance of the tactical mitigation system is less than one per 100 000 flight hours, corresponding to 1E-5 losses per flight hour.

The criteria cover procedure definition, procedure complexity, and consideration of potential human error, and describe expectations for low, medium, and high levels of integrity.\n\nFor Criterion #1, which concerns procedure definition, a low level of integrity requires that operational procedures appropriate for the proposed operation are defined. As a minimum, these procedures cover flight planning, pre- and post-flight inspections, procedures to evaluate environmental conditions before and during the mission including real-time evaluation, procedures to cope with unexpected adverse operating conditions such as encountering ice during an operation not approved for icing conditions, normal procedures, contingency procedures to cope with abnormal situations, emergency procedures to cope with emergency situations, and occurrence-reporting procedures. In addition, the limitations of external systems supporting the UAS operation are defined in an operations manual. Operational procedures are stated to cover the deterioration of the UAS itself and any external system supporting the UAS operation. To properly address deterioration of external systems required for the operation, it is recommended to identify the external systems, identify modes of deterioration of those systems such as complete loss of GNSS, GDOP or PDOP degradation, latency issues and similar effects that could lead to a loss of control of the operation, describe the means to detect those modes of deterioration, and describe the procedures used when deterioration is detected, such as activation of emergency recovery capability or a switch to manual control. External systems supporting the UAS operation are defined as systems not already part of the UAS that are used to launch or take off the unmanned aircraft, make pre-flight checks, or keep the unmanned aircraft within its operational volume, for example GNSS, satellite systems, air traffic management, or U-space. External systems activated or used after a loss of control of the operation are excluded from this definition.\n\nFor Criterion #2, which concerns procedure complexity, a low level of integrity applies when operational procedures are complex and may potentially jeopardise the crew’s ability to respond by increasing the remote crew’s workload and or their interaction with other entities such as air traffic management. At a medium level of integrity, contingency and emergency procedures require manual control by the remote pilot when the UAS is usually automatically controlled. It is noted that not all UAS have a mode in which the pilot could directly control the surfaces, and that significant skill may be required to avoid making the situation worse. At a high level of integrity, operational procedures are simple.\n\nFor Criterion #3, which concerns consideration of potential human error, a low level of integrity requires that operational procedures provide, as a minimum, a clear distribution and assignment of tasks and an internal checklist to ensure staff are adequately performing their assigned tasks. At a medium level of integrity, operational procedures explicitly take human error into consideration. At a high level of integrity, the requirements of the medium level apply and, in addition, the remote crew receives crew resource management training.

This appraisal demonstrates that the design and installation features, including independence, separation, and redundancy, satisfy the low integrity criterion. It also shows that particular risks relevant to the concept of operations, such as hail, ice, snow, or electromagnetic interference, do not violate any claimed independence features.\n\nAt a medium level of assurance, all requirements applicable at the low level remain in place. In addition, the level of integrity claimed is substantiated by analysis and or test data, supported by appropriate evidence. If the operation is classified as SAIL IV, the competent authority should request the applicant to use a UAS for which EASA has verified the claimed integrity through a design verification report.\n\nAt a high level of assurance, the competent authority should request the applicant to use a UAS for which EASA has issued a type certificate or a restricted type certificate. This certification is issued in accordance with Annex I, Part 21, to Regulation (EU) No 748/2012. No additional comments are associated with any of the assurance levels."

This introduces independent confirmation that the automatic flight envelope protection meets the required integrity objectives.\n\nAt a high level of assurance, all the requirements of the medium level apply. In addition, the competent authority should request the applicant to use a UAS for which EASA has issued either a type certificate or a restricted type certificate. This certification must be in accordance with Annex I, Part 21, to Regulation (EU) No 748/2012.

These restrictions primarily involve limiting the geographical volume in which the UAS operates or limiting the operational time frame. Examples include restricting flights to specific airspace boundaries, operating only at certain altitudes, or flying during times of day when manned aircraft activity is minimal, such as night operations. Another form of operational restriction is mitigation by exposure, which limits the duration of time the UAS is exposed to higher-risk environments.

    "chunk_title": "Reducing the Initial Air Risk Class (ARC) Using Strategic Mitigations in SORA Annex C",
    "chunk_text": "This content explains how a UAS operator may optionally reduce the initially assigned Air Risk Class (ARC) by applying strategic mitigations within the SORA framework. Two ARC concepts are defined: the initial ARC, which is a qualitative classification of collision risk in the operational volume before strategic mitigations are applied, and the residual ARC, which represents the collision risk after all strategic mitigations have been applied.\n\nIf the UAS operator agrees that the generalised initial ARC applicable to the operation and operational volume is correct, no reduction is required and the assessment proceeds directly to the step that assigns the detect-and-avoid tactical mitigation performance requirements. When reductions are proposed, the SORA provides guidance and examples to help the operator demonstrate, through acceptable evidence, that the collision risk within the operational volume is lower than initially assessed. The SORA encourages open dialogue between the applicant, the competent authority, and the air navigation service provider to determine what evidence is acceptable.\n\nLowering the initial ARC to a residual ARC-a is intended only for operations in atypical or segregated airspace and requires a higher level of safety verification because no tactical mitigation is required at this level. To justify a residual ARC-a, the operator must demonstrate that the operational volume meets the requirements for atypical or segregated airspace and complies with any additional requirements mandated by the competent authority. A residual ARC-a does not automatically remove obligations related to seeing and avoiding other aircraft or remaining well clear. To comply with applicable rules, the operator must either provide an acceptable alternate means of compliance or obtain a waiver from the competent authority.\n\nThe SORA allows ARC reduction through operational restrictions by means of a two-step approach. First, the operator determines the initial ARC based on generalised airspace encounter rates derived from known airspace density environments. Second, the operator provides evidence that the local operational environment, subject to the proposed restrictions, has a lower airspace encounter rate than the generalised environment. If accepted by the competent authority, the initial ARC may be reduced to a lower residual ARC. This assessment may be qualitative, supported where possible by quantitative data, and must prioritise the safety of manned aircraft.\n\nAir risk is influenced by three interdependent variables related to encounters: proximity, geometry, and dynamics. These variables do not contribute equally to collision risk, and small changes in one variable may have significant effects. For simplicity, the SORA allows only the manipulation of proximity, represented by aircraft density. Lowering airspace density does not directly translate into a proportional reduction in collision risk, and there is no one-to-one correlation between individual encounter variables and ARC levels.\n\nTo justify ARC reduction, the UAS operator must collect and analyse local airspace density data and demonstrate that operational restrictions reduce the encounter rate compared to the generalised assessment. This justification should be presented as a safety case, scaled in complexity to the nature of the operation. Using a safety case structure provides clarity for both the operator and the competent authority and facilitates understanding of why a reduction in ARC is justified.\n\nThe SORA provides examples illustrating how ARC reductions may be justified in different environments, such as operations in controlled or uncontrolled airspace, at varying altitudes, and over urbanised areas, based on demonstrated differences between generalised and local airspace density.\n\nStrategic mitigation through common structures and rules is also addressed. Aviation rules and airspace structures already reduce collision risk, particularly as aircraft density increases. Very low level airspace is generally avoided by manned aircraft except for specific situations, but UAS operations are expected to increase activity in this airspace. Future services, such as U-space, are anticipated to provide common structures and rules requiring mandatory participation by all aircraft in that airspace.\n\nThe SORA does not permit ARC reduction through common structures and rules for certain airspace encounter categories because those mitigations are already accounted for in the initial assessment, and further reduction would result in double counting. In other cases, the maximum ARC reduction allowed through structures and rules is one level. ARC reduction through this method is permitted for operations below approximately 150 metres above ground level in very low level airspace, subject to specific conditions.\n\nTo claim an ARC reduction using common structures and rules, the UAS operator must demonstrate that the unmanned aircraft is equipped with an electronic cooperative system and navigation and anti-collision lighting, that procedures exist to verify and notify other airspace users of the operation, that permission has been obtained from the airspace owner when applicable, and that the operation complies with applicable flight rules, regulations, and policies. Additional requirements include the existence of a UAS airspace structure such as U-space, mandatory procedural separation services, and the ability for all UAS operators to communicate directly with air traffic or flight information services. The operator is responsible for collecting and analysing the data needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategic mitigations to the competent authority.",

Two ARC concepts are defined: the initial ARC, which is a qualitative classification of collision risk in the operational volume before strategic mitigations are applied, and the residual ARC, which represents the collision risk after all strategic mitigations have been applied.\n\nIf the UAS operator agrees that the generalised initial ARC applicable to the operation and operational volume is correct, no reduction is required and the assessment proceeds directly to the step that assigns the detect-and-avoid tactical mitigation performance requirements. When reductions are proposed, the SORA provides guidance and examples to help the operator demonstrate, through acceptable evidence, that the collision risk within the operational volume is lower than initially assessed. The SORA encourages open dialogue between the applicant, the competent authority, and the air navigation service provider to determine what evidence is acceptable.\n\nLowering the initial ARC to a residual ARC-a is intended only for operations in atypical or segregated airspace and requires a higher level of safety verification because no tactical mitigation is required at this level. To justify a residual ARC-a, the operator must demonstrate that the operational volume meets the requirements for atypical or segregated airspace and complies with any additional requirements mandated by the competent authority. A residual ARC-a does not automatically remove obligations related to seeing and avoiding other aircraft or remaining well clear. To comply with applicable rules, the operator must either provide an acceptable alternate means of compliance or obtain a waiver from the competent authority.\n\nThe SORA allows ARC reduction through operational restrictions by means of a two-step approach. First, the operator determines the initial ARC based on generalised airspace encounter rates derived from known airspace density environments. Second, the operator provides evidence that the local operational environment, subject to the proposed restrictions, has a lower airspace encounter rate than the generalised environment. If accepted by the competent authority, the initial ARC may be reduced to a lower residual ARC. This assessment may be qualitative, supported where possible by quantitative data, and must prioritise the safety of manned aircraft.\n\nAir risk is influenced by three interdependent variables related to encounters: proximity, geometry, and dynamics. These variables do not contribute equally to collision risk, and small changes in one variable may have significant effects. For simplicity, the SORA allows only the manipulation of proximity, represented by aircraft density. Lowering airspace density does not directly translate into a proportional reduction in collision risk, and there is no one-to-one correlation between individual encounter variables and ARC levels.\n\nTo justify ARC reduction, the UAS operator must collect and analyse local airspace density data and demonstrate that operational restrictions reduce the encounter rate compared to the generalised assessment. This justification should be presented as a safety case, scaled in complexity to the nature of the operation. Using a safety case structure provides clarity for both the operator and the competent authority and facilitates understanding of why a reduction in ARC is justified.\n\nThe SORA provides examples illustrating how ARC reductions may be justified in different environments, such as operations in controlled or uncontrolled airspace, at varying altitudes, and over urbanised areas, based on demonstrated differences between generalised and local airspace density.\n\nStrategic mitigation through common structures and rules is also addressed. Aviation rules and airspace structures already reduce collision risk, particularly as aircraft density increases. Very low level airspace is generally avoided by manned aircraft except for specific situations, but UAS operations are expected to increase activity in this airspace. Future services, such as U-space, are anticipated to provide common structures and rules requiring mandatory participation by all aircraft in that airspace.\n\nThe SORA does not permit ARC reduction through common structures and rules for certain airspace encounter categories because those mitigations are already accounted for in the initial assessment, and further reduction would result in double counting. In other cases, the maximum ARC reduction allowed through structures and rules is one level. ARC reduction through this method is permitted for operations below approximately 150 metres above ground level in very low level airspace, subject to specific conditions.\n\nTo claim an ARC reduction using common structures and rules, the UAS operator must demonstrate that the unmanned aircraft is equipped with an electronic cooperative system and navigation and anti-collision lighting, that procedures exist to verify and notify other airspace users of the operation, that permission has been obtained from the airspace owner when applicable, and that the operation complies with applicable flight rules, regulations, and policies. Additional requirements include the existence of a UAS airspace structure such as U-space, mandatory procedural separation services, and the ability for all UAS operators to communicate directly with air traffic or flight information services. The operator is responsible for collecting and analysing the data needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategic mitigations to the competent authority."

Tactical mitigations are defined as mitigations applied after take-off and are represented in the air risk model as a dynamic mitigating feedback loop. This feedback loop reduces the rate of collision by modifying the geometry and dynamics of aircraft in conflict based on real-time information about potential encounters.\n\nTactical mitigations are applied to bridge the gap between the residual risk of an encounter, expressed as the residual Air Risk Class, and the airspace safety objectives. The residual risk represents the remaining collision risk after all applicable strategic mitigations have been applied.\n\nTwo classifications of tactical mitigation are defined. The first is visual line-of-sight operations, in which a pilot or observer uses human vision to detect other aircraft and take action to remain well clear and avoid collisions. The second is beyond visual line-of-sight operations, in which an alternate means to human vision is used, such as machine-based or machine-assisted systems, including air traffic control separation services, traffic collision avoidance systems, detect-and-avoid systems, or U-space services.\n\nFor visual line-of-sight operations, the traditional regulatory concept of see and avoid is adapted to account for remote piloting. The UAS is kept close enough to the remote pilot or observer to allow unaided human vision to detect and avoid other aircraft, with the possible exception of corrective lenses. Visual line-of-sight is generally considered an acceptable means of compliance with requirements to remain well clear and avoid collisions. It can provide sufficient mitigation for low, medium, and high tactical mitigation requirements, although additional national rules or authority-imposed conditions may apply. In some cases, the competent authority may determine that visual line-of-sight alone is insufficient and require additional measures. The UAS operator must document a visual line-of-sight de-confliction scheme describing detection methods, avoidance criteria, communication procedures, and protocols, and this strategy must be approved by the competent authority. The use of visual line-of-sight does not remove the requirement to perform the full SORA risk analysis.\n\nFor beyond visual line-of-sight operations, tactical mitigation is generally achieved through detect-and-avoid solutions. These solutions may be ground-based, air-based, or a combination of both, and may include various sensors, architectures, and levels of human involvement. TMPR defines the total amount of tactical mitigation required to further reduce collision risk that could not be mitigated strategically. The required TMPR increases as the residual Air Risk Class increases. Multiple tactical mitigations may be combined, but their interactions and interdependencies must be carefully considered, as combined systems acting on the same event may reduce overall effectiveness or introduce unintended consequences.\n\nTMPR assignment is based on the findings of multiple studies that define performance guidance using risk ratios. These risk ratios form the basis for TMPR requirements. Qualitative criteria are also provided to help translate quantitative risk ratio values into functional system requirements. Where there is a conflict, the quantitative objectives take precedence over qualitative guidance.\n\nQualitative TMPR criteria are organised around five sub-functions of detect-and-avoid: detect, decide, command, execute, and the feedback loop. References to detecting a percentage of aircraft are intended to reflect detection of the overall mix of aircraft expected in the detection volume, not only a specific subset.\n\nThe effectiveness of tactical mitigation systems depends on the equipment carried by both the unmanned aircraft and the threat aircraft. Equipment that supports the detect, decide, command, execute, and feedback functions improves overall tactical performance. However, not all aircraft carry the same equipment, and equipment mixes vary by airspace and location. A mitigation system effective against transponder-equipped aircraft may not mitigate risks posed by aircraft without transponders. General aviation aircraft are typically less equipped than commercial aircraft, and systems such as FLARM, ACAS, or TCAS may be effective in some airspaces but not others. Consequently, the UAS operator must understand the equipment environment of the intended airspace and select tactical mitigation systems that are effective for that context.\n\nFinally, TMPR robustness is addressed through integrity and assurance requirements.

Airspace conditions require that the unmanned aircraft be operated either in atypical airspace included in uncontrolled airspace, or in controlled airspace that the competent authority has defined as meeting atypical airspace requirements, with the appropriate coordination.\n\nVisibility requirements state that when take-off and landing are conducted within visual line of sight of the remote pilot, visibility must be sufficient to ensure that people are not endangered. The remote pilot must abort take-off or landing if people on the ground are at risk. Additional operational restrictions specify that the unmanned aircraft must not be used to drop material or carry dangerous goods, except for agricultural, horticultural, or forestry activities where such carriage does not contravene applicable regulations.\n\nFor each condition, the integrity requirement repeatedly states that a reference to the relevant chapter or section of the operations manual must be included. The method of proof is predominantly self-declaration, with the operator declaring compliance, and in certain cases providing supporting data or descriptions, such as explaining how population density data is identified. Notes indicate that the integrity and proof sections are to be filled in by the UAS operator."

    "chunk_text": "The operational mitigations describe the requirements that must be applied to define and protect the operational volume, manage ground and air risks, and ensure safe interaction with the surrounding environment during UAS operations. To determine the operational volume, the UAS operator is required to consider the position-keeping capabilities of the unmanned aircraft in four dimensions, namely latitude, longitude, height, and time. In particular, the accuracy of the navigation solution, the flight technical error of the unmanned aircraft, the path definition error such as map inaccuracies, and system latencies must be taken into account when defining the limits of the operational volume. If there is any indication that the unmanned aircraft may exceed those limits, the remote pilot is required to apply the defined emergency procedures without delay.\n\nTo mitigate ground risk, the UAS operator must establish a ground risk buffer outside the operational volume in order to protect third parties on the ground. The default criterion for defining this buffer is the application of the 1:1 rule, meaning that if the unmanned aircraft is planned to operate at a given height, the ground risk buffer must be at least equal to that height. A smaller ground risk buffer may be applied for rotary-wing unmanned aircraft using a ballistic methodology approach that is acceptable to the competent authority. However, it is noted that in certain cases the 1:1 rule may not be sufficient to meet the target level of safety, and the competent authority may require a refinement of the ground risk buffer definition based on the criteria defined in SORA Step 9, taking into account adjacent air and ground risks. The operational volume together with the ground risk buffer must be fully contained within a sparsely populated area. The UAS operator must also evaluate the area of operations, typically through on-site inspection or appraisal, and be able to justify a significantly lower density of people at risk than in sparsely populated areas across the entire operational volume, including the ground risk buffer.\n\nWhere operations are conducted over or near facilities or infrastructure, the UAS operator must ensure that the person or entity responsible for that facility or infrastructure has implemented the necessary measures to protect uninvolved persons present within its limits during the UAS operation. The operator is further required to include the conditions related to ground risk mitigation in the Operations Manual and formally declare compliance with those conditions.\n\nAir risk mitigation requirements specify that the UAS operation must be conducted in atypical airspace. For the purpose of this PDRA, atypical airspace includes reserved or segregated airspace where the claim for ARC-a is met and where such airspace has been established and approved for UAS operations, with the operational volume and any applicable air risk buffer fully contained within it. Operations may also be conducted at a flight geography height of less than 30 metres. When operating in proximity to natural or artificial obstacles such as trees, buildings, towers, cranes, fences, or power lines with a height below 20 metres, the unmanned aircraft must be kept within 30 metres horizontal distance and 30 metres vertical distance from the top of the obstacle. When operating near obstacles higher than 20 metres, the unmanned aircraft must maintain a horizontal distance of 30 metres and a vertical distance of 15 metres from the top of the obstacle.\n\nThe operation must be conducted away from known permanent or temporary take-off and landing areas for manned aircraft, including parking lots, parks, and other areas where helicopters occasionally operate, as well as sites used by police, helicopter emergency medical services, and search and rescue helicopters during emergencies. The unmanned aircraft must also remain clear of known military aircraft low-flying routes, other known low-level manned aircraft operations within the intended area of operation such as authorised balloon operations below 500 feet, harbour or coastal areas where search and rescue operations may transit or operate, and any known areas where other unmanned aircraft operate, including model aircraft club or association areas.\n\nAn air risk buffer must be established outside the operational volume to protect third parties in the air when airspace classified as ARC-d is adjacent to the operational volume, or when the competent authority or the entity responsible for airspace management determines that such protection is necessary. This air risk buffer must be contained in airspace where the probability of encounter with manned aircraft and other airspace users is low, as defined by the competent authority. Before each flight, the UAS operator is required to assess the proximity of the planned UAS operation to manned aircraft activity. Across all mitigation measures, the method of proof is self-declaration, with repeated requirements to include references to the relevant chapters or sections of the Operations Manual and to declare compliance.",

    "chunk_title": "Technical Conditions for Unmanned Aircraft Systems Operations",
    "chunk_text": "This section defines the technical conditions applicable to the UAS to ensure safe operation. The UAS must be equipped with means to monitor critical flight parameters. These parameters include the UA position, height or altitude, ground speed or airspeed, attitude, and trajectory, as well as the UAS energy status such as fuel level or battery charge. In addition, the status of critical functions and systems must be monitored. As a minimum, for services based on radio frequency signals, including the command-and-control link and GNSS, the UAS must provide monitoring of adequate performance and trigger an alert when performance levels become too low. For each of these requirements, a reference to the relevant chapter or section of the Operations Manual is to be included, and compliance is declared.\n\nThe UAS performance, and in particular its capability to maintain position in four-dimensional space defined by latitude, longitude, height, and time, must allow the remote pilot to safely conduct operations close to natural or artificial obstacles. It is noted that the UAS should be capable of flying safely at a distance closer than 30 metres to artificial or natural obstacles. The UAS must also provide means to programme the flight path before take-off or, if flexible routes are used, be equipped with means to avoid obstacles while remaining within the intended operational volume. Where flexible routes are utilised, the UAS must include means to prevent the aircraft from breaching the horizontal and vertical limits of a programmable operational volume. The UAS must be protected against potential electromagnetic interference originating from infrastructure or facilities located in the overflown area.\n\nThe human–machine interface must present UAS information and control interfaces in a clear and succinct manner. The interface must not confuse the operator, cause unreasonable fatigue, or create disturbances to personnel in charge of duties essential to the UAS operation that could adversely affect operational safety. The UAS operator is required to conduct an evaluation that considers and addresses human factors in order to determine whether the human–machine interface is appropriate for the intended operation.\n\nWith regard to command-and-control links and communications, the UAS must comply with applicable requirements for radio equipment and the use of the radio frequency spectrum. Protection mechanisms against interference must be implemented, particularly when unlicensed bands such as ISM bands are used for the command-and-control link.

This section defines the technical conditions applicable to the UAS to ensure safe operation. The UAS must be equipped with means to monitor critical flight parameters. These parameters include the UA position, height or altitude, ground speed or airspeed, attitude, and trajectory, as well as the UAS energy status such as fuel level or battery charge. In addition, the status of critical functions and systems must be monitored. As a minimum, for services based on radio frequency signals, including the command-and-control link and GNSS, the UAS must provide monitoring of adequate performance and trigger an alert when performance levels become too low. For each of these requirements, a reference to the relevant chapter or section of the Operations Manual is to be included, and compliance is declared.\n\nThe UAS performance, and in particular its capability to maintain position in four-dimensional space defined by latitude, longitude, height, and time, must allow the remote pilot to safely conduct operations close to natural or artificial obstacles. It is noted that the UAS should be capable of flying safely at a distance closer than 30 metres to artificial or natural obstacles. The UAS must also provide means to programme the flight path before take-off or, if flexible routes are used, be equipped with means to avoid obstacles while remaining within the intended operational volume. Where flexible routes are utilised, the UAS must include means to prevent the aircraft from breaching the horizontal and vertical limits of a programmable operational volume. The UAS must be protected against potential electromagnetic interference originating from infrastructure or facilities located in the overflown area.\n\nThe human–machine interface must present UAS information and control interfaces in a clear and succinct manner. The interface must not confuse the operator, cause unreasonable fatigue, or create disturbances to personnel in charge of duties essential to the UAS operation that could adversely affect operational safety. The UAS operator is required to conduct an evaluation that considers and addresses human factors in order to determine whether the human–machine interface is appropriate for the intended operation.\n\nWith regard to command-and-control links and communications, the UAS must comply with applicable requirements for radio equipment and the use of the radio frequency spectrum. Protection mechanisms against interference must be implemented, particularly when unlicensed bands such as ISM bands are used for the command-and-control link. Examples of such mechanisms include FHSS, DSSS, OFDM technologies, or frequency deconfliction by procedure. The UAS must be equipped with a command-and-control link protected against unauthorised access to command-and-control functions.

This buffer must cover a distance at least equal to the distance most likely to be travelled by the unmanned aircraft after activation of the flight termination system specified by the manufacturer, taking into account the operational conditions and manufacturer limitations. When operations are conducted above 120 metres and up to 150 metres, an air risk buffer must be established to protect third parties in the air outside the operational volume. If the air risk buffer is part of controlled airspace, coordination with the relevant air navigation service provider is required, and procedures must be developed to ensure other airspace users are not jeopardised. The operational volume must be located outside any geographical zone corresponding to a flight restriction zone of a protected aerodrome or any other type, unless appropriate permission has been granted. Prior to flight, the proximity of the planned operation to manned aircraft activity must be assessed.\n\nWhen airspace observers are employed, the unmanned aircraft may be operated at a distance greater than that otherwise allowed without observers, provided additional conditions are met. These include correct placement and adequate number of observers along the intended flight path, verification that observer visibility and planned distances are within acceptable limits, confirmation that there are no terrain obstructions or gaps in coverage between observers, establishment of effective communication between the remote pilot and observers, and ensuring that any means used by observers to determine the position of the unmanned aircraft are functional and effective. Observers must also be briefed on the planned flight path and associated timing. If no observer is employed, the operation must be conducted with the unmanned aircraft flying no further from the remote pilot than the specified distance and following a preprogrammed trajectory when the aircraft is not in the visual line of sight of the remote pilot.\n\nUAS operator and operational conditions require the development of an operations manual in accordance with the applicable specifications and guidance material. The operator must define the operational volume and ground risk buffer in the operations manual, develop procedures to ensure compliance with security requirements and protection against unlawful interference or unauthorised access, and ensure compliance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. Guidelines must be developed for remote pilots to minimise nuisance, including noise and other emissions, to people and animals. The adequacy of contingency and emergency procedures must be ensured and demonstrated through flight tests, simulations, or other means acceptable to the competent authority. An emergency response plan suitable for the intended operation and consistent with a medium level of robustness must be developed.\n\nAdditional requirements include uploading updated information into the geo-awareness function when such a system is installed and required, ensuring that the controlled ground area is established and effective before starting the operation, and ensuring that all persons present in the controlled ground area have been informed of the risks, briefed or trained on safety precautions, and have explicitly agreed to participate. For each flight, a remote pilot with adequate competency must be designated, and efficient use of the radio spectrum must be ensured to avoid harmful interference. Records of UAS operations, including unusual technical or operational occurrences, must be maintained for a minimum of three years.\n\nMaintenance conditions require that UAS maintenance instructions defined by the operator and included in the operations manual cover at least the manufacturer’s instructions and requirements when applicable. Maintenance staff must follow these instructions, records of maintenance activities must be kept for at least three years, and an up-to-date list of maintenance staff must be maintained. Compliance with applicable specifications is required if certified equipment is used. For external services necessary for flight safety, the operator must ensure that the level of performance is adequate and declare that this level is achieved.

This predefined risk assessment describes the characterisation, operational risk classification, mitigations, and organisational conditions applicable to PDRA-S02 operations under Article 11 of the UAS Regulation. The operational characterisation establishes that no autonomous operations are permitted and that the remote pilot must maintain control of the unmanned aircraft, except in the case of a loss of the command-and-control link. The remote pilot is required to operate only one unmanned aircraft at a time, must not operate from a moving vehicle, and must not hand over control of the unmanned aircraft to another command unit.\n\nThe operational range limitations specify that operations must keep the unmanned aircraft in sight of the remote pilot during launch and recovery, unless recovery results from an emergency flight termination. If no airspace observer is employed, the unmanned aircraft must remain no further than 1 kilometre from the remote pilot. When one or more airspace observers are employed, the unmanned aircraft may operate up to 2 kilometres from the remote pilot. Operations are required to be conducted over a controlled ground area.\n\nUnmanned aircraft limitations include a maximum take-off mass of less than 25 kilograms, including payload, and maximum characteristic dimensions, such as wingspan, rotor diameter or area, or maximum distance between rotors in the case of a multirotor, of less than 3 metres. The unmanned aircraft must have a maximum ground speed in level flight of not more than 50 metres per second.\n\nFlight height limitations require the remote pilot to maintain the unmanned aircraft within 120 metres from the closest point of the surface of the Earth, unless specific provisions are applied. Measurements must be adapted to the geographical characteristics of the terrain, such as plains, hills, or mountains. When flying within 50 metres horizontally from an artificial obstacle taller than 105 metres, the maximum height of the operation may be increased up to 15 metres above the height of the obstacle at the request of the entity responsible for that obstacle. The UAS operator may propose operations above 120 metres and up to 150 metres, provided that a risk buffer is defined in accordance with the applicable mitigation provisions.\n\nAirspace conditions require that the unmanned aircraft be operated either in uncontrolled airspace, unless different limitations are provided by Member States for their UAS geographical zones where the probability of encountering manned aircraft is not low, or in controlled airspace following coordination and flight authorisation in accordance with published procedures to ensure a low probability of encountering manned aircraft. Airspace with an air risk classified as not higher than ARC-b may be considered as having a low probability of encountering manned aircraft. Visibility conditions require that operations be conducted in areas where flight visibility is greater than 5 kilometres.

The operator declares compliance and confirms that record-keeping data are available for inspection at the request of the competent authority.\n\nThe remote pilot must have the authority to cancel or delay any or all flight operations if certain conditions arise. These include situations where the safety of persons is jeopardised, where property on the ground is at risk, where other airspace users are in jeopardy, or where there is a violation of the terms of the operational authorisation. For each of these cases, a reference to the relevant chapter or section of the operations manual is requested, and compliance is declared.\n\nAdditional requirements apply specifically to the remote pilot. The remote pilot must not perform duties under the influence of psychoactive substances or alcohol, or when unfit due to injury, fatigue, medication, sickness, or other causes. The remote pilot must be familiar with the manufacturer’s instructions provided for the UAS and must ensure that the UA remains clear of clouds. The remote pilot is required to hold a certificate of remote pilot theoretical knowledge in accordance with Attachment A to Chapter I of Appendix 1 to the Annex to the UAS Regulation, issued either by the competent authority or by an entity designated by that authority. In addition, the remote pilot must hold an accreditation or completion certificate for a practical-skills training course applicable to this PDRA, in accordance with Attachment A to Chapter I of Appendix 1 to the Annex to the UAS Regulation.\n\nWhere operations are conducted at a height between 120 m and 150 m, the remote pilot must receive additional theoretical knowledge training. This training covers raising awareness about air risk and the existence of other airspace users, checking height determination and limitation devices, using procedures for coordination between the remote pilot and any airspace observers, and using the applicable procedures in case a manned aircraft is detected. The remote pilot must also obtain updated information relevant to the intended operation concerning any geographical zones defined in accordance with Article 15 of the UAS Regulation.\n\nBefore starting the UAS operation, the remote pilot must ensure that the UAS is in a safe condition to complete the intended flight safely and, where applicable, check that the direct remote identification is active and up to date. Prior to the operation, the remote pilot must verify that the remote identification system is operational, obtain updated information about applicable geographical zones, ensure again that the UAS is in a safe condition for flight, set the programmable flight volume to keep the UA within the defined flight geography, and verify that the means to terminate the flight and the programmable flight volume functionality are operational.\n\nDuring the flight, unless supported by airspace observers, the remote pilot must maintain a thorough visual scan of the surrounding airspace to avoid any risk of collision with manned aircraft. The remote pilot must discontinue the flight if the operation poses a risk to other aircraft, people, animals, the environment, or property. The remote pilot must maintain control of the UA except in the case of a loss of the command-and-control link, operate only one UA at a time, not operate the UA from a moving vehicle, and not hand control of the UA over to another control unit. When airspace observers are employed, the remote pilot must inform them in a timely manner of any deviations from the intended flight path or associated timing.

The assurance level for most mitigations is based on self-declaration, with integrity demonstrated by references to the relevant chapters or sections of the Operations Manual and assurance demonstrated through a declaration of compliance, unless otherwise specified.\n\nThe UAS operator is required to define the operational volume, the ground risk buffer, and the adjacent volume for the intended operation. This definition must include the flight geography and the contingency volume. For untethered unmanned aircraft, the contingency volume must extend at least 10 metres beyond the external limits of the flight geography. When determining the operational volume, the operator must take into account the position-keeping capabilities of the unmanned aircraft in four-dimensional space, including latitude, longitude, height, and time.\n\nIn particular, the accuracy of the navigation solution, the flight technical error of the unmanned aircraft, as well as flight path definition errors such as map errors, and system latencies must be considered and addressed when defining the operational volume. The size of the adjacent volume must also be clearly defined. The remote pilot is required to apply emergency procedures as soon as there is an indication that the unmanned aircraft may exceed the limits of the operational volume.\n\nOperational mitigations further specify that no persons are to be overflown when spraying liquids or dropping substances. Infrastructure or facilities may only be overflown at the request of the entity responsible for that infrastructure or facility.\n\nWith respect to ground risk, the UAS operator must establish a ground risk buffer to protect third parties on the ground outside the operational volume. For untethered unmanned aircraft, the ground risk buffer must extend beyond the external limits of the contingency area by a minimum distance that depends on the maximum height above ground level and the maximum take-off mass of the unmanned aircraft. At a maximum height of 10 metres, the minimum ground risk buffer is 5 metres for an unmanned aircraft with a maximum take-off mass of up to 10 kilograms and 10 metres for a maximum take-off mass greater than 10 kilograms. At 30 metres, the buffer increases to 10 metres and 20 metres respectively. At 60 metres, the buffer is 15 metres for up to 10 kilograms and 30 metres for greater than 10 kilograms. At 90 metres, the buffer is 20 metres and 45 metres respectively. At 120 metres, the buffer is 25 metres for up to 10 kilograms and 60 metres for greater than 10 kilograms. At 150 metres, the buffer is 30 metres for up to 10 kilograms and 75 metres for greater than 10 kilograms. For tethered unmanned aircraft, the ground risk buffer is addressed through the conditions defined earlier for tethered operations.\n\nFor air risk, when the operation is performed above 120 metres and up to 150 metres, the UAS operator must establish an air risk buffer to protect third parties in the air outside the operational volume. If the air risk buffer lies within controlled airspace, the operation must be coordinated with the relevant air navigation service provider. The operator must also develop appropriate procedures to ensure that other airspace users are not jeopardised. This includes describing how remote pilots, and airspace observers if employed, are able to assess the height of the unmanned aircraft in relation to other airspace users.\n\nAdditional air risk mitigations require that the operational volume be located outside any geographical zone corresponding to a flight restriction zone of a protected aerodrome or any other restricted area, unless specific permission has been granted by the responsible authority. Prior to the flight, the UAS operator must assess the proximity of the planned operation to manned aircraft activity. A de-confliction scheme must be established to allow the remote pilot to take efficient decisions in the event of incoming traffic.\n\nRegarding observers, airspace observers are indicated as not applicable, while the use of unmanned aircraft observers is referenced to another section identified as point 5.3.9(b).",

    "chunk_text": "This section sets out the conditions applicable to personnel who perform duties essential to the unmanned aircraft system operation under PDRA-S01. The requirements cover general organisational responsibilities, the authority and obligations of the remote pilot, qualification and training requirements, and detailed duties before and during flight. Assurance is primarily based on self-declaration or declaration supported by data, with evidence maintained for inspection by the competent authority.\n\nFrom a general perspective, the UAS operator is required to keep and maintain up-to-date records of all relevant qualifications and training courses completed by the remote pilot, other personnel essential to the UAS operation, and maintenance staff. These records must be retained for at least three years after the individuals cease to be employed by the organisation or change position within it. The remote pilot must be granted the authority to cancel or delay any or all flight operations whenever the safety of persons is jeopardised, property on the ground is jeopardised, other airspace users are in jeopardy, or there is a violation of the terms of the operational authorisation.\n\nSpecific conditions apply to the remote pilot. The remote pilot must not perform any duties under the influence of psychoactive substances or alcohol, nor when unfit to perform tasks due to injury, fatigue, medication, sickness, or other causes. The remote pilot must be familiar with the manufacturer’s instructions for the unmanned aircraft system and must ensure that the unmanned aircraft remains clear of clouds. The remote pilot is required to hold a certificate of remote pilot theoretical knowledge in accordance with Attachment A to Chapter I of Appendix 1 to the Annex to the UAS Regulation, issued either by the competent authority or by an entity designated by the competent authority of a Member State.\n\nIn addition, the remote pilot must hold an accreditation of completion of a practical-skills training course for this PDRA, in accordance with Attachment A to Chapter I of Appendix 1 to the Annex to the UAS Regulation. This accreditation must be issued either by an entity that has declared compliance with the requirements of Appendix 3 to the Annex to the UAS Regulation and is recognised by the competent authority of a Member State, or by a UAS operator that has been authorised by the competent authority of the Member State of registration to operate according to this PDRA, or that has declared compliance with STS-01 and with the requirements of Appendix 3 to the Annex to the UAS Regulation.\n\nWhere operations are conducted at heights between 120 metres and 150 metres, the remote pilot must undergo additional theoretical knowledge training. This training must address raising awareness of air risk and the existence of other airspace users, checking height determination and limitation devices, and using applicable procedures when a manned aircraft is detected. As an alternative to holding the theoretical knowledge certificate and the practical-skills accreditation, the operator may propose a dedicated training syllabus to the competent authority.\n\nBefore starting the UAS operation, the remote pilot must verify that the means to terminate the unmanned aircraft flight and the remote identification system are operational. The remote pilot must obtain updated information relevant to the intended operation concerning any geographical zones defined in accordance with Article 15 of the UAS Regulation. The remote pilot must also ensure that the unmanned aircraft is in a safe condition to complete the intended flight safely and, where applicable, verify that the direct remote identification is active and up to date.\n\nDuring the flight, the remote pilot must keep the unmanned aircraft in visual line of sight and maintain a thorough visual scan of the surrounding airspace to avoid any risk of collision with manned aircraft. The flight must be discontinued if the operation poses a risk to other aircraft, people, animals, the environment, or property. For this purpose, the remote pilot may be assisted by a unmanned aircraft observer, provided that clear and effective communication is established between them. The remote pilot must apply the contingency procedures defined by the UAS operator for abnormal situations, including situations where there is an indication that the unmanned aircraft may exceed the limits of the flight geography. Emergency procedures must also be applied for emergencies, including triggering the means to terminate the flight when there is an indication that the unmanned aircraft may exceed the limits of the operational volume. The means to terminate the flight must be triggered at least 10 metres before the unmanned aircraft reaches the limits of the operational volume.\n\nAdditional in-flight requirements specify that, in the case of untethered unmanned aircraft, the remote pilot must keep the unmanned aircraft at a ground speed of less than 5 metres per second and must activate the direct remote identification system.",

This section sets out the conditions applicable to personnel who perform duties essential to the unmanned aircraft system operation under PDRA-S01. The requirements cover general organisational responsibilities, the authority and obligations of the remote pilot, qualification and training requirements, and detailed duties before and during flight. Assurance is primarily based on self-declaration or declaration supported by data, with evidence maintained for inspection by the competent authority.\n\nFrom a general perspective, the UAS operator is required to keep and maintain up-to-date records of all relevant qualifications and training courses completed by the remote pilot, other personnel essential to the UAS operation, and maintenance staff. These records must be retained for at least three years after the individuals cease to be employed by the organisation or change position within it. The remote pilot must be granted the authority to cancel or delay any or all flight operations whenever the safety of persons is jeopardised, property on the ground is jeopardised, other airspace users are in jeopardy, or there is a violation of the terms of the operational authorisation.\n\nSpecific conditions apply to the remote pilot. The remote pilot must not perform any duties under the influence of psychoactive substances or alcohol, nor when unfit to perform tasks due to injury, fatigue, medication, sickness, or other causes. The remote pilot must be familiar with the manufacturer’s instructions for the unmanned aircraft system and must ensure that the unmanned aircraft remains clear of clouds. The remote pilot is required to hold a certificate of remote pilot theoretical knowledge in accordance with Attachment A to Chapter I of Appendix 1 to the Annex to the UAS Regulation, issued either by the competent authority or by an entity designated by the competent authority of a Member State.\n\nIn addition, the remote pilot must hold an accreditation of completion of a practical-skills training course for this PDRA, in accordance with Attachment A to Chapter I of Appendix 1 to the Annex to the UAS Regulation. This accreditation must be issued either by an entity that has declared compliance with the requirements of Appendix 3 to the Annex to the UAS Regulation and is recognised by the competent authority of a Member State, or by a UAS operator that has been authorised by the competent authority of the Member State of registration to operate according to this PDRA, or that has declared compliance with STS-01 and with the requirements of Appendix 3 to the Annex to the UAS Regulation.\n\nWhere operations are conducted at heights between 120 metres and 150 metres, the remote pilot must undergo additional theoretical knowledge training. This training must address raising awareness of air risk and the existence of other airspace users, checking height determination and limitation devices, and using applicable procedures when a manned aircraft is detected. As an alternative to holding the theoretical knowledge certificate and the practical-skills accreditation, the operator may propose a dedicated training syllabus to the competent authority.\n\nBefore starting the UAS operation, the remote pilot must verify that the means to terminate the unmanned aircraft flight and the remote identification system are operational. The remote pilot must obtain updated information relevant to the intended operation concerning any geographical zones defined in accordance with Article 15 of the UAS Regulation. The remote pilot must also ensure that the unmanned aircraft is in a safe condition to complete the intended flight safely and, where applicable, verify that the direct remote identification is active and up to date.\n\nDuring the flight, the remote pilot must keep the unmanned aircraft in visual line of sight and maintain a thorough visual scan of the surrounding airspace to avoid any risk of collision with manned aircraft. The flight must be discontinued if the operation poses a risk to other aircraft, people, animals, the environment, or property. For this purpose, the remote pilot may be assisted by a unmanned aircraft observer, provided that clear and effective communication is established between them. The remote pilot must apply the contingency procedures defined by the UAS operator for abnormal situations, including situations where there is an indication that the unmanned aircraft may exceed the limits of the flight geography. Emergency procedures must also be applied for emergencies, including triggering the means to terminate the flight when there is an indication that the unmanned aircraft may exceed the limits of the operational volume. The means to terminate the flight must be triggered at least 10 metres before the unmanned aircraft reaches the limits of the operational volume.\n\nAdditional in-flight requirements specify that, in the case of untethered unmanned aircraft, the remote pilot must keep the unmanned aircraft at a ground speed of less than 5 metres per second and must activate the direct remote identification system."

As a primary option, the UAS operator should use a UAS that is marked as class C5 and that complies with the requirements of that class, as defined in Part 16 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) 2019/945. In this case, the operator declares that the UAS is marked with a class C5 identification label, or declares that this requirement is not applicable.\n\nAs an alternative to using a class C5 UAS, the operator may use a UAS that complies with the requirements of Part 16 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) 2019/945, with specific exceptions. Under this alternative, the UAS does not need to bear a class C3 or class C5 identification label, does not need to have a maximum take-off mass of less than 25 kg, and does not need to be exclusively powered by electricity, provided that the operator ensures that the environmental impact caused by the use of non-electric UAS is minimised. In addition, the UAS must include an information notice published by EASA that provides the applicable limitations and obligations required by the UAS Regulation. If the UAS is privately built, the manufacturer’s instructions must be included; however, information on its operation and maintenance, as well as on the training of the remote pilot, must be included in the operations manual.\n\nIt is noted that compliance with point (9) of Part 4 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) 2019/945 may be achieved through the use of an add-on that complies with Part 6 of the Annex to that Regulation. Furthermore, if the unmanned aircraft does not bear a physical serial number compliant with standard ANSI/CTA 2063-A on small unmanned aerial systems serial numbers, and or does not have an integrated system of direct remote identification, compliance with point (9) of Part 4 may likewise be achieved by using an add-on that complies with Part 6 of the Annex.\n\nAdditional containment-related conditions apply when the adjacent area does not include a populated area or an assembly of people and when the adjacent airspace is classified as ARC-a or ARC-b. In such cases, point 5 of Part 16 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) 2019/945 may be replaced by basic containment conditions. These conditions require that no probable failure of the UAS or of any external system supporting the operation would lead to operation outside the operational volume, and that it is reasonably expected that a fatality will not occur due to any probable failure of the UAS or of any external system supporting the operation.\n\nFor these containment provisions, the operator may declare that basic containment applies and that a design and installation appraisal is available. This appraisal must cover at least the design and installation features, including independence, separation, and redundancy, as well as the particular risks relevant to the type of operation, such as hail, ice, snow, or electromagnetic interference. Alternatively, the operator may declare that enhanced containment applies and declare compliance with MoC Light-UAS.2511, with analysis and or test data and supporting evidence available, or declare that the UAS has a design verification report demonstrating compliance with the enhanced containment requirements.\n\nWhere the unmanned aircraft is designed to spray, additional technical conditions apply. The unmanned aircraft must be designed to avoid the accidental release of any substance, and it must provide the remote pilot with the means to immediately stop the spraying of liquids or the dropping of substances in case of an emergency.",

In addition, the typical kinetic energy of the unmanned aircraft, as defined in paragraph 2.3.1(k) of AMC1 to Article 11 of the UAS Regulation, must be up to 34 kilojoules. Compliance with these limitations is based on self-declaration with appropriate references to the operations manual.\n\nThe flight height of the operation is limited by the size of the reserved or segregated airspace in which the operation takes place. In addition to the vertical limit of the operational volume, an air risk buffer must be considered, as further addressed under the air risk conditions.

Under operational volume considerations, the UAS operator is required to determine the operational volume by taking into account the position-keeping capabilities of the UAS in four-dimensional space, defined as latitude, longitude, height, and time. Particular attention must be given to the accuracy of the navigation solution, the flight technical error of the UAS, path definition errors such as map errors, and system latencies when defining this operational volume. The remote pilot is required to apply emergency procedures as soon as there is an indication that the unmanned aircraft may exceed the limits of the defined operational volume. For each of these conditions, the integrity section requests that a reference be included to the relevant chapter or section of the operations manual, and the proof section indicates that compliance is declared through a self-declaration.\n\nGround risk mitigations are also detailed. The UAS operator must establish a ground risk buffer to protect third parties outside the operational volume. As a minimum criterion, the use of the ‘1:1 rule’ is specified, meaning that if the unmanned aircraft is planned to operate at a height of 150 metres, the ground risk buffer should be at least 150 metres. In addition, both the operational volume and the ground risk buffer must be entirely contained within a sparsely populated area. These ground risk measures are subject to self-declaration, with integrity demonstrated by referencing the appropriate section of the operations manual and proof provided through a declaration of compliance.\n\nFurther PDRA characterisation and conditions address the evaluation of the area of operations. The applicant is required to assess the area of operations, typically by means of an on-site inspection or appraisal, and must be able to justify a reduced density of people at risk within both the operational area and the ground risk buffer. In relation to air risk, the operational volume, including the air risk buffer where applicable, must be entirely contained within reserved or segregated airspace.

For each of these conditions, the integrity section requests that a reference be included to the relevant chapter or section of the operations manual, and the proof section indicates that compliance is declared through a self-declaration.\n\nGround risk mitigations are also detailed. The UAS operator must establish a ground risk buffer to protect third parties outside the operational volume. As a minimum criterion, the use of the ‘1:1 rule’ is specified, meaning that if the unmanned aircraft is planned to operate at a height of 150 metres, the ground risk buffer should be at least 150 metres. In addition, both the operational volume and the ground risk buffer must be entirely contained within a sparsely populated area. These ground risk measures are subject to self-declaration, with integrity demonstrated by referencing the appropriate section of the operations manual and proof provided through a declaration of compliance.\n\nFurther PDRA characterisation and conditions address the evaluation of the area of operations. The applicant is required to assess the area of operations, typically by means of an on-site inspection or appraisal, and must be able to justify a reduced density of people at risk within both the operational area and the ground risk buffer. In relation to air risk, the operational volume, including the air risk buffer where applicable, must be entirely contained within reserved or segregated airspace. As with the other conditions, the integrity requirement calls for a reference to the relevant section of the operations manual, and proof is provided by a declaration of compliance."

    "chunk_title": "Technical Conditions for UAS Equipment, Interfaces, Communications, Containment, and Identification",
    "chunk_text": "This content defines the technical conditions applicable to an unmanned aircraft system under a predefined risk assessment. The general technical requirement states that the UAS must be equipped with means to monitor the critical parameters necessary for safe flight. These parameters include the unmanned aircraft’s position, height or altitude, ground speed or airspeed, attitude, and trajectory. The system must also provide monitoring of the UAS energy status, such as fuel level or battery charge. In addition, the status of critical functions and systems must be monitored. As a minimum, for services based on radio-frequency signals such as the command-and-control link and GNSS, the system must be capable of monitoring adequate performance and triggering an alert when performance becomes too low. Compliance with these monitoring requirements is demonstrated by including references to the relevant sections of the operations manual and by a declaration of compliance.\n\nHuman–machine interface requirements specify that UAS information and control interfaces must be clearly and succinctly presented. The interfaces must not confuse personnel, cause unreasonable fatigue, or contribute to disturbances that could adversely affect the safety of the operation. The UAS operator is required to conduct an evaluation that considers and addresses human factors in order to determine whether the human–machine interface is appropriate for the intended operation. Compliance is shown through references to the operations manual or by describing how this condition is met, supported by a declaration of compliance.\n\nRequirements for command-and-control links and communication state that the UAS must comply with the applicable requirements for radio equipment and the use of the radio-frequency spectrum. Protection mechanisms against interference must be used, particularly when unlicensed bands such as ISM bands are employed for the command-and-control link. Examples of such mechanisms include frequency-hopping spread spectrum, direct-sequence spread spectrum, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing technologies, or frequency deconfliction by procedure. The command-and-control link must also be protected against unauthorised access to the command-and-control functions. In the event of loss of the command-and-control link, the UAS must have a reliable and predictable method to recover the link or to terminate the flight in a manner that reduces any undesirable effects on third parties in the air or on the ground. The operator must ensure that reliable and continuous means of two-way communication are available for the purpose identified elsewhere in the conditions. These requirements are addressed through references to the operations manual and declarations of compliance.\n\nContainment provisions require that, to ensure safe recovery from a technical issue involving the UAS or any external system supporting the operation, the UAS complies with basic containment conditions. It must be ensured that no probable failure of the UAS or of any supporting external system would lead to operation outside the operational volume. It must also be reasonably expected that a fatality will not occur due to any probable failure of the UAS or of any external supporting system. The term ‘probable’ is defined qualitatively as anticipated to occur one or more times during the entire system or operational life of an item. Compliance is demonstrated by describing how these conditions are met and by providing a declaration supported by data, such as a design and installation appraisal covering design and installation features including independence, separation, and redundancy, as well as particular risks such as hail, ice, snow, or electromagnetic interference that are relevant to the type of operation.\n\nEnhanced containment conditions apply when the adjacent area includes an assembly of people or when the adjacent airspace is classified as ARC-d in accordance with SORA. In such cases, the UAS must be designed to standards considered adequate by the competent authority or in accordance with an acceptable means of compliance. The probability of the unmanned aircraft leaving the operational volume must be less than 10 to the power of minus four per flight hour, and no single failure of the UAS or of any external system supporting the operation should lead to operation outside the ground risk buffer. Failures are defined as occurrences that affect the operation of a component, part, or element such that it can no longer function as intended, while errors are not considered failures. Some structural or mechanical failures may be excluded if it can be shown that the parts were designed according to aviation industry best practices. Software and airborne electronic hardware whose development errors could directly lead to operations outside the ground risk buffer must be developed according to an industry standard or methodology recognised as adequate by EASA. Notes clarify that the additional safety conditions cover both integrity and assurance levels and do not necessarily imply a systematic need to develop software and airborne electronic hardware to a recognised industry standard if design features systematically prevent exit from the ground risk buffer.\n\nRemote identification requirements state that the UAS must have a unique serial number compliant with ANSI/CTA-2063-A-2019, Small Unmanned Aerial Systems Serial Numbers, in accordance with Article 40(4) of Regulation (EU) 2019/945. The UAS must also be equipped with a remote identification system in accordance with Article 40(5) of Regulation (EU) 2019/945. Compliance with these requirements is demonstrated by describing how the conditions are met and by a declaration of compliance.\n\nFinally, lighting requirements specify that if the UAS is operated at night, it must be equipped with at least one green flashing light in accordance with point UAS.SPEC.050(1)(l)(i) of the UAS Regulation.

It applies to operations using unmanned aircraft with maximum characteristic dimensions of up to 3 metres. Examples of characteristic dimensions are given, including wingspan, rotor diameter or rotor area, or the maximum distance between rotors in the case of a multirotor aircraft. These aircraft are further limited to a typical kinetic energy of up to 34 kilojoules.\n\nThe operations covered by this PDRA are conducted beyond visual line of sight of the remote pilot, with visual air risk mitigation in place. They are limited to operations carried out over sparsely populated areas. The scope also specifies an altitude limitation, stating that the operation must be conducted at less than 150 metres, or 500 feet, above the surface overflown, unless another altitude reference is defined by the relevant Member State.

The document explains that this predefined risk assessment is the result of applying the methodology described in AMC1 Article 11 of the UAS Regulation to unmanned aircraft system operations that are conducted within the ‘specific’ category.\n\nThe scope defines the types of operations that fall under this PDRA. It applies to operations using unmanned aircraft with maximum characteristic dimensions of up to 3 metres. Examples of characteristic dimensions are given, including wingspan, rotor diameter or rotor area, or the maximum distance between rotors in the case of a multirotor aircraft. These aircraft are further limited to a typical kinetic energy of up to 34 kilojoules.\n\nThe operations covered by this PDRA are conducted beyond visual line of sight of the remote pilot, with visual air risk mitigation in place. They are limited to operations carried out over sparsely populated areas. The scope also specifies an altitude limitation, stating that the operation must be conducted at less than 150 metres, or 500 feet, above the surface overflown, unless another altitude reference is defined by the relevant Member State. Finally, the operations must take place in uncontrolled airspace."

    "chunk_text": "This content describes the operational characterisation, scope, and limitations applicable to UAS operations conducted under a predefined risk assessment. The level of human intervention is defined by the requirement that no autonomous operations are allowed. The remote pilot must have the ability to maintain control of the unmanned aircraft at all times, except in the event of a loss of the command-and-control link. In addition, the remote pilot is required to operate only one unmanned aircraft at a time. Further limitations specify that the remote pilot must not operate the unmanned aircraft from a moving vehicle and must not hand control of the unmanned aircraft over to another command unit. Compliance with these conditions is demonstrated through references to the relevant sections of the operations manual and by declarations of compliance.\n\nOperational range limitations apply to both launch and recovery and to flight operations. Launch and recovery must take place at visual line-of-sight distance from the remote pilot if operations are not conducted from a safe prepared area. A safe prepared area is defined as a controlled ground area that is suitable for the safe launch and recovery of the unmanned aircraft. During flight, if no air observers are employed, the unmanned aircraft must not be operated further than one kilometre, or another distance defined by the competent authority, from the remote pilot. A note specifies that the remote pilot’s workload must allow continuous visual scanning of the airspace. If air observers are employed, the range is not limited provided that the unmanned aircraft is not operated further than one kilometre, unless otherwise defined by the competent authority, from the air observer who is nearest to the unmanned aircraft. These conditions are subject to self-declaration with references to the operations manual or indication of not applicable, as appropriate.\n\nRequirements concerning overflown areas state that UAS operations must be conducted over sparsely populated areas. The method of proof requires a declaration supported by data, including a reference to the relevant section of the operations manual where procedures for determining population density are described. Proof also requires a declaration of compliance and a description of how population density data is identified.\n\nUnmanned aircraft limitations include a maximum characteristic dimension of three metres. Examples of characteristic dimensions include wingspan, rotor diameter or rotor area, or the maximum distance between rotors in the case of a multirotor aircraft. The typical kinetic energy of the unmanned aircraft must be up to 34 kilojoules, as defined in paragraph 2.3.1(k) of AMC1 to Article 11 of the UAS Regulation. Compliance with these limitations is demonstrated by references to the operations manual and declarations of compliance.\n\nFlight height limitations require that the maximum height of the operational volume must not exceed 150 metres, or 500 feet, above the overflown area, or any other altitude reference defined by the Member State. A note clarifies that, in addition to the vertical limit of the operational volume, an air risk buffer must be considered, as addressed under air risk requirements. These conditions are subject to self-declaration with references to the operations manual and declarations of compliance.\n\nAirspace requirements specify that the unmanned aircraft must be operated either in uncontrolled airspace corresponding to an air risk that can be classified as ARC-b, in a segregated area corresponding to an air risk that can be classified as ARC-a, or as otherwise established by the Member States in accordance with Article 15, with an associated air risk that can be classified as not higher than ARC-b. Each of these options requires a reference to the relevant section of the operations manual and a declaration of compliance.\n\nVisibility requirements state that the unmanned aircraft must be operated in an area where flight visibility is greater than five kilometres. A note refers to GM1 UAS.STS-02.020(3). Compliance is demonstrated through a reference to the relevant section of the operations manual and a declaration of compliance.\n\nAdditional operational limitations specify that the unmanned aircraft must not be used to drop material or to carry dangerous goods. An exception is provided for dropping items in connection with agricultural, horticultural, or forestry activities, where the carriage of such items does not contravene any other applicable regulations. Compliance with this condition is demonstrated through a reference to the relevant section of the operations manual and a declaration of compliance.",

    "chunk_text": "The content describes a set of predefined risk assessment conditions related to unmanned aircraft system operations, focusing on operational mitigations, ground risk, air risk, and the use of observers. Under operational volume considerations, the applicant is required to determine the operational volume by accounting for the position-keeping capabilities of the unmanned aircraft system in four-dimensional space, including latitude, longitude, height, and time. This determination must consider the accuracy of the navigation solution, the flight technical error of the unmanned aircraft system, the flight path definition error such as map errors, and any latencies. The remote pilot is required to apply emergency procedures immediately when there is an indication that the unmanned aircraft may exceed the limits of the defined operational volume. For each of these operational mitigation points, the integrity requirement requests the inclusion of a reference to the relevant chapter or section of the operations manual, and the proof is provided through a declaration of compliance.\n\nGround risk mitigation requirements specify that the unmanned aircraft system operator must establish a ground risk buffer to protect third parties on the ground outside the operational volume. The minimum criterion for this buffer is the use of the one-to-one rule, meaning that if the unmanned aircraft is planned to operate at a height of 150 metres, the ground risk buffer should be at least 150 metres. The operational volume together with the ground risk buffer must be entirely contained within a sparsely populated area. The applicant is also expected to evaluate the area of operations, typically through an on-site inspection or appraisal, and to be able to justify a lower density of people at risk within both the operational area and the ground risk buffer. These ground risk conditions are supported by self-declaration, require references to the operations manual in the integrity column, and are demonstrated through a declaration of compliance.\n\nAir risk mitigation conditions require the unmanned aircraft system operator to establish an air risk buffer to protect third parties in the air outside the operational volume. This air risk buffer must be contained within airspace that meets defined conditions and must be over sparsely populated areas. If the operation is limited to a height below 120 metres, no additional vertical air risk buffer is required. If the height of the operation is above 120 metres and up to 150 metres, supporting evidence must be included in the operations manual, along with justification that the appropriate air risk buffer is documented. The operational volume must also be outside any geographical zone corresponding to a flight restriction zone unless the operator has been granted appropriate permission. Prior to flight, the remote pilot must assess the proximity of the planned operation to manned aircraft activity. Integrity requirements again request references to the relevant sections of the operations manual, and proof is generally provided by a declaration of compliance, with additional supporting evidence where height exceeds 120 metres.\n\nAdditional conditions apply when operations are performed above 120 metres and up to 150 metres. In such cases, the unmanned aircraft system operator is required to develop appropriate procedures to ensure that other airspace users are not jeopardised. The integrity requirement asks for a reference to the operations manual and a description of how remote pilots and, if employed, airspace observers are able to assess the height of the unmanned aircraft compared to other airspace users. Proof consists of a declaration of compliance supported by evidence included in the operations manual.\n\nObserver-related provisions state that if the unmanned aircraft system operator decides to employ one or more airspace observers, the remote pilot may operate the unmanned aircraft up to the distance specified elsewhere. The operator must ensure the correct placement and appropriate number of observers along the intended flight path. Before each flight, the operator must verify that the visibility and planned distance of the observers are within acceptable limits defined in the operations manual, that there are no potential terrain obstructions for each observer, that there are no gaps between the zones covered by each observer, and that communication with each observer is established and effective. If means are used by observers to determine the position of the unmanned aircraft, those means must be functioning and effective.

    "chunk_text": "The content describes the conditions applicable to personnel who are responsible for duties essential to unmanned aircraft system operations, as defined within a predefined risk assessment framework. It begins by stating that the UAS operator must ensure that all such personnel receive competency-based theoretical and practical training that is specific to their assigned duties. This training includes applicable theoretical elements derived from AMC1 UAS.SPEC.050(1)(d) and practical elements from AMC2 UAS.SPEC.050(1)(d) and UAS.SPEC.050(1)(e). For non-remote pilots, additional training elements are also derived from AMC3 UAS.SPEC.050(1)(d). Compliance is declared, with evidence of training available for inspection upon request by the competent authority, and the training programme documented in the operations manual.\n\nThe operator is also required to keep and maintain up-to-date records of all relevant qualifications and training courses completed by the remote pilot, other personnel in charge of duties essential to the UAS operation, and maintenance staff. These records must be retained for at least three years after the individuals cease to be employed by the organisation or change position within it. Compliance is declared, and record-keeping data must be available for inspection by the competent authority upon request.\n\nThe conditions further specify the responsibilities of the remote pilot. The remote pilot must have the authority to cancel or delay any or all flight operations when the safety of persons is jeopardised, when property on the ground is jeopardised, when other airspace users are jeopardised, or when there is a violation of the terms of the operational authorisation. For each of these circumstances, a reference to the relevant chapter or section of the operations manual is requested, and compliance is declared.\n\nIf air observers are employed, the remote pilot must ensure that the necessary number of observers is available and correctly positioned, and that communication with them can be adequately established. The remote pilot is also required to meet several personal and operational conditions, including not performing duties under the influence of psychoactive substances or alcohol, or when unfit due to injury, fatigue, medication, sickness, or other causes. The remote pilot must be familiar with the manufacturer’s instructions for the UAS, ensure that the unmanned aircraft remains clear of clouds, perform an unaided visual scan of the airspace to avoid potential collision hazards, obtain updated information relevant to the intended operation regarding geographical zones defined in accordance with Article 15 of the UAS Regulation, and ensure that the UAS is in a safe condition to complete the intended flight, including checking that direct remote identification is active and up to date if applicable. For all these conditions, references to the relevant sections of the operations manual are requested and compliance is declared.\n\nWhere multi-crew cooperation is required, the UAS operator must designate a remote pilot-in-command responsible for each flight. Procedures must be included to ensure coordination between remote crew members through robust and effective communication channels. As a minimum, these procedures must cover the assignment of tasks to remote crew members and the establishment of step-by-step communication. The operator must also ensure that the training of the remote crew covers multi-crew cooperation. For these conditions, references to the operations manual are requested, and compliance is declared or marked as not applicable where appropriate.\n\nMaintenance staff are also addressed. Any maintenance staff member authorised by the UAS operator to perform maintenance activities must have been adequately trained in the documented maintenance procedures. Compliance is declared, supporting evidence is included in the operations manual, and evidence of training must be available to the competent authority upon request.\n\nFinally, personnel in charge of duties essential to the UAS operation are required to declare that they are fit to operate before conducting any operation, based on the policy defined by the UAS operator.

The content describes the conditions applicable to personnel who are responsible for duties essential to unmanned aircraft system operations, as defined within a predefined risk assessment framework. It begins by stating that the UAS operator must ensure that all such personnel receive competency-based theoretical and practical training that is specific to their assigned duties. This training includes applicable theoretical elements derived from AMC1 UAS.SPEC.050(1)(d) and practical elements from AMC2 UAS.SPEC.050(1)(d) and UAS.SPEC.050(1)(e). For non-remote pilots, additional training elements are also derived from AMC3 UAS.SPEC.050(1)(d). Compliance is declared, with evidence of training available for inspection upon request by the competent authority, and the training programme documented in the operations manual.\n\nThe operator is also required to keep and maintain up-to-date records of all relevant qualifications and training courses completed by the remote pilot, other personnel in charge of duties essential to the UAS operation, and maintenance staff. These records must be retained for at least three years after the individuals cease to be employed by the organisation or change position within it. Compliance is declared, and record-keeping data must be available for inspection by the competent authority upon request.\n\nThe conditions further specify the responsibilities of the remote pilot. The remote pilot must have the authority to cancel or delay any or all flight operations when the safety of persons is jeopardised, when property on the ground is jeopardised, when other airspace users are jeopardised, or when there is a violation of the terms of the operational authorisation. For each of these circumstances, a reference to the relevant chapter or section of the operations manual is requested, and compliance is declared.\n\nIf air observers are employed, the remote pilot must ensure that the necessary number of observers is available and correctly positioned, and that communication with them can be adequately established. The remote pilot is also required to meet several personal and operational conditions, including not performing duties under the influence of psychoactive substances or alcohol, or when unfit due to injury, fatigue, medication, sickness, or other causes. The remote pilot must be familiar with the manufacturer’s instructions for the UAS, ensure that the unmanned aircraft remains clear of clouds, perform an unaided visual scan of the airspace to avoid potential collision hazards, obtain updated information relevant to the intended operation regarding geographical zones defined in accordance with Article 15 of the UAS Regulation, and ensure that the UAS is in a safe condition to complete the intended flight, including checking that direct remote identification is active and up to date if applicable. For all these conditions, references to the relevant sections of the operations manual are requested and compliance is declared.\n\nWhere multi-crew cooperation is required, the UAS operator must designate a remote pilot-in-command responsible for each flight. Procedures must be included to ensure coordination between remote crew members through robust and effective communication channels. As a minimum, these procedures must cover the assignment of tasks to remote crew members and the establishment of step-by-step communication. The operator must also ensure that the training of the remote crew covers multi-crew cooperation. For these conditions, references to the operations manual are requested, and compliance is declared or marked as not applicable where appropriate.\n\nMaintenance staff are also addressed. Any maintenance staff member authorised by the UAS operator to perform maintenance activities must have been adequately trained in the documented maintenance procedures. Compliance is declared, supporting evidence is included in the operations manual, and evidence of training must be available to the competent authority upon request.\n\nFinally, personnel in charge of duties essential to the UAS operation are required to declare that they are fit to operate before conducting any operation, based on the policy defined by the UAS operator. A reference to the relevant section of the operations manual is requested, and compliance is declared."

    "chunk_text": "This content sets out the technical conditions, limitations, and compliance expectations applicable to PDRA-G01 operations for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). It begins with technical conditions requiring the UAS to be equipped with monitoring capabilities for critical flight parameters. These include the unmanned aircraft position, height or altitude, ground speed or airspeed, attitude, and trajectory, as well as the UAS energy status such as fuel or battery charge. The system must also provide visibility of the status of critical functions and systems, including services based on radio-frequency signals such as the command-and-control link and GNSS, with alerts triggered when performance becomes too low. In addition, the UAS must be capable of descending safely from its operating altitude to a defined safe altitude within less than one minute, or at a descent rate of at least 2.5 m/s (500 feet per minute).\n\nHuman–machine interface requirements specify that UAS information and control interfaces must be clearly and succinctly presented, must not confuse the operator, must not cause unreasonable fatigue, and must not disturb personnel responsible for duties essential to safe operation. Where electronic means are used to support air observers in maintaining awareness of the UAS position, the interface must be easy to understand and must not degrade the observers’ ability to perform unaided visual scanning of the airspace for collision hazards or to maintain effective communication with the remote pilot at all times. The UAS operator is also required to conduct a human factors evaluation to determine whether the interface is appropriate for the intended operation.\n\nConditions related to command-and-control links and communications require compliance with applicable radio equipment and radio-frequency spectrum requirements. Protection mechanisms against interference must be used, particularly when unlicensed bands such as ISM bands are employed, using techniques such as frequency hopping, direct sequence spread spectrum, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, or procedural frequency deconfliction. The command-and-control link must be protected against unauthorised access, and in the event of a loss of the link, the UAS must have a reliable and predictable method to recover the link or to terminate the flight in a way that reduces undesirable effects on third parties in the air or on the ground. Communication between the remote pilot and air observers must allow sufficient time to manoeuvre the unmanned aircraft to avoid collision with manned aircraft, in accordance with UAS.SPEC.060(3)(b).\n\nTactical mitigation provisions require that the UAS design ensures the time between a command given by the remote pilot and the execution of that command by the unmanned aircraft does not exceed five seconds. Where electronic means assist the remote pilot or air observers in awareness of potential airspace intruders, information such as position, speed, altitude, and track must be provided with latency and update rates that support decision criteria.\n\nContainment requirements aim to ensure safe recovery from technical issues involving the UAS or supporting external systems. There must be no probable failure of the UAS or supporting systems that would lead to operation outside the operational volume, and it must be reasonably expected that fatalities will not occur due to any probable failure. The vertical extension of the operational volume is defined as 150 metres above the surface, or another reference altitude defined by the Member State. The term ‘probable’ is clarified as meaning anticipated to occur one or more times during the entire system or operational life of an item.\n\nEnhanced containment conditions apply when the adjacent area includes assemblies of people or when adjacent airspace is classified as ARC-d. In such cases, the UAS should be designed to standards considered adequate by the competent authority or comply with acceptable means of compliance. This includes limiting the probability of the unmanned aircraft leaving the operational volume to less than 10^-4 per flight hour and ensuring that no single failure of the UAS or supporting systems leads to operation outside the ground risk buffer. Software and airborne electronic hardware whose development errors could directly lead to operation outside the ground risk buffer must be developed according to industry standards or methodologies recognised as adequate by EASA. Notes clarify the definition of ‘failure’ and explain that some mechanical failures may be excluded if designed according to aviation best practices, and that the additional safety conditions cover both integrity and assurance levels.\n\nRemote identification requirements state that the UAS must have a unique serial number compliant with ANSI/CTA-2063-A-2019 and be equipped with a remote identification system in accordance with Articles 40(4) and 40(5) of Regulation (EU) 2019/945. Lighting requirements specify that if the UAS is operated at night, it must be equipped with at least one green flashing light in accordance with UAS.SPEC.050(1)(l)(i). Throughout the conditions, the integrity and proof expectations commonly require references to relevant chapters or sections of the operations manual, descriptions of how conditions are met, or formal declarations of compliance, with ‘n/a’ indicated where conditions do not apply.",
